<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE trench wound a sinuous way through the
sodden Flanders mud. Underfoot were boards;
and then sandbags; and then more boards, added as
the mud rose up and swallowed all that was put down
upon it. Some of the last-added boards had almost
disappeared, ground out of sight by the trampling feet
of hundreds of men: a new battalion had relieved,
three nights before, the men who had held that part of
the line for a week, and when a relief arrives, a trench
becomes uncomfortably filled, and the ground underfoot
is churned into deep glue. It was more than
time to put down another floor; to which the only
objection was that no more flooring material was
available, and had there been, no one had time to
fetch it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the second trench. Beyond it was another,
occupied by British soldiers: beyond that again, a
mass of tangled barbed-wire, and then the strip of
No-Man’s Land dividing the two armies—a strip
ploughed up by shells and scarred with craters formed
by the bursting of high explosives. Here and there
lay rifles, and spiked German helmets, and khaki
caps; but no living thing was visible save the cheeky
Flemish sparrows that hopped about the quiet space,
chirping and twittering as if trying to convince themselves
and everybody else that War was hundreds of
miles away. The sparrows carried out this pleasant
deception every morning, abandoning the attempt as
soon as the first German gun began what the British
soldiers, disagreeably interrupted in frying bacon,
termed “the breakfast hate.” Then they retreated
precipitately to the sparrow equivalent to a dug-out,
to meditate in justifiable annoyance on the curious
ways of men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the second trench the men were weary and heavy-eyed,
and even bacon had scant attractions for them.
It was their first experience of trench-life complicated
by shell-fire, and since their arrival the enemy had
been “hating” with a vigour that seemed to argue
on his part a peculiar sourness of temper. Now, after
two days of incessant artillery din and three nights
of the strenuous toil that falls upon the trenches with
darkness, the new men bore evidence of exhaustion.
Casualties had been few, considering the violent nature
of the bombardment; but to those who had never
before seen Death come suddenly, an even slighter
loss would have been horrifying. The ceaseless nerve-shattering
roar of the big guns pounded in their brains
long after darkness had put an end to the bombardment;
their brief snatches of sleep were haunted
by the white faces of the comrades with whom they
would laugh and fight and work no more. They were
stiff and sore with crouching under the parapets and
in the narrow dug-outs; dazed with noise, sullen with
the anger of men who have been forced to endure
without making any effort to hit back. But their
faces had hardened under the test. A few were shrinking,
“jumpy,” useless: but the majority had stiffened
into men. When the time for hitting back came, they
would be ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawn on the fourth morning found them weary
enough, but, on the whole, in better condition than
they had been two days earlier. They were getting
used to it; and even to artillery bombardment
“custom hath made a property of easiness.” The
first sense of imminent personal danger had faded
with each hour that found most of them still alive.
Discipline and routine, making each officer and man
merely part of one great machine, steadied them into
familiar ways, even in that unfamiliar setting. And
above all was satisfaction that after months of slow
training on barrack-square and peaceful English fields
they were at last in the middle of the real thing—doing
their bit. It had been conveyed to them that
they were considered to be shaping none too badly:
a curt testimonial, which, passing down the line, had
lent energy to a hard night of rebuilding parapets,
mending barbed-wire, and cleaning up battered sections
of trench. They were almost too tired to eat. But
the morning—so far—was peaceful; the sunlight was
cheery, the clean breeze refreshing. Possibly to-day
might find the Hun grown weary of hating so noisily.
There were worse things than even a trench in Flanders
on a bright April morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim Linton sat on a small box outside his dug-out,
drinking enormous quantities of tea, and making a less
enthusiastic attempt to demolish the contents of an
imperfectly heated tin of bully beef. He was bare-headed,
owing to the fact that a portion of shrapnel
had removed his cap the day before, luckily without
damaging the head inside it. Mud plastered him from
neck to heels. He was a huge boy, well over six feet,
broad-shouldered and powerful; and the bronze which
the sun of his native Australia had put into his face
had been proof against the trench experiences that
had whitened English cheeks, less deeply tanned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another second lieutenant came hastily round a
traverse and tripped over his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s an awful lot of you in a trench!” said the
new-comer, recovering himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry,” said Jim. “I can’t find any other place
to put them; they <span class='it'>will</span> stick out. Never mind, the
mud will bury them soon; it swallows them if I forget
to move them every two minutes. Come and have
breakfast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want oceans of tea,” said Wally Meadows, dragging
a biscuit-tin from the dug-out, perching it precariously
on a small board island in the mud, and
seating himself with caution. He glanced with disfavour
at the beef-tin. “Is that good?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beastly,” Jim answered laconically. “Smith’s
strong point is not cookery. It’s faintly warm and
exceedingly tough; and something with moisture in
it seems to have happened to the biscuits. But the
tea is topping. I told Smith to bring another supply
presently. Bacon’s a bit short, so I said we preferred
bully.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally accepted a tin mug of milkless tea with
gratitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s great,” he said, after a beatific pause,
putting down the empty mug. He pushed his cap
back from his tired young face, and heaved a great
sigh of relief. “Blessings on whoever discovered
tea! I don’t think I’ll have any beef, thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you will,” Jim said, firmly. “I know it’s
beastly, and one isn’t hungry, but it’s a fool game
not to eat. If we have any luck there may be some
work to-day; and you can’t fight if you don’t eat
something. The first mouthful is the worst.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chum took the beef-tin meekly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you’re right,” he said. “If we only
do get a chance of fighting, I should think we’d have
enormous appetites afterwards; but one can’t get
hungry hiding in this beastly hole and letting Brother
Boche sling his tin cans at us. Wouldn’t you give
something for a bath and twelve hours’ sleep?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove, yes!” Jim agreed. “But I don’t mind
postponing them if only we get a smack at those gentry
across the way first. Did you see Anstruther?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—he’s better. He dodged the R.A.M.C. men—said
he wasn’t going to be carted back because of a
knock on the head. He’s tied up freshly and looks
awfully interesting, but he declares he’s quite fit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Anstruther was the company commander, a
veteran of one-and-twenty, with eight months’ service.
The two Australian boys, nineteen and eighteen respectively,
and fully conscious of their own limitations,
regarded him with great respect in his official capacity,
and, off duty, had clearly demonstrated their ability
to dispose of him, with the gloves on, within three
rounds. They were exceedingly good friends. Anstruther
could tell stories of the Marne, of the retreat
from Mons, of the amazing tangle of the first weeks
of war, which had left him, then a second lieutenant,
in sole command of the remnant of his battalion.
To the two Australians he was a mine of splendid
information. They were mildly puzzled at what he
demanded in return—bush “yarns” of their own
country, stories of cattle musterings, of aboriginals,
of sheep-shearing by machinery, of bush-fire fighting;
even of football as played at their school in Melbourne.
To them these things, interesting enough in peacetime
and in their own setting, were commonplace and
stale in the trenches, with Europe ablaze with battle
all round them. Anstruther, however, looked on war
with an eye that saw little of romance: willing to see
it through, but with no illusions as to its attractions.
He greatly preferred to talk of bush-fires, which he had
not seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yesterday a shell which had wrecked far too much
of a section of trench to be at all comfortable had provided
this disillusioned warrior with a means of escape,
had he so wished, by knocking him senseless, with a
severe scalp-wound. Counselled to seek the dressing-station
at the rear, when he had recovered his senses,
however, he had flatly declined; all his boredom lost
in annoyance at his aching head, and a wild desire to
obtain enemy scalps in vengeance. Jim and Wally
had administered first-aid with field dressings, and
the wounded one, declaring himself immediately cured,
had hidden himself and his bandages from any intrusive
senior who might be hard-hearted enough to insist
on his retirement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a near thing,” Jim said reflectively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So was yours,” stated his chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—my old cap?—a miss is as good as a mile,”
said Jim. “I’m glad it wasn’t a bit nearer, though;
it would be a bore to be put out of business without
ever having seen a German, let alone finding out which
of us could ‘get his fist in fust.’ ” He rose, feeling
for his pipe. “Have you eaten your whack of that
stuff?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve done my best,” said Wally, displaying the
tin, nearly empty. “Can’t manage any more. Let’s
have a walk along the trench and see what’s happening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, keep your silly head down,” Jim said. “The
parapet is getting more and more uneven, and you
never remember you’re six feet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally grinned. Each of the friends suffered under
the belief that he was extremely careful and the other
destined to sudden death from unwittingly exposing
himself to a German sniper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you followed your own advice, grandmother,”
he said; “you being three inches taller, and six times
more careless! I always told your father and Norah
that you’d be an awful responsibility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll put you under arrest if you’re not civil,” Jim
threatened. “Small boys aren’t allowed to be impertinent
on active service!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They floundered along in the mud, ducking whenever
the parapet was low: sandbags had run short,
and trench-repairing on the previous night had been
like making bricks without straw. The men were
finishing breakfast, keeping close to the dug-outs, since
at any moment the first German shell might scream
overhead. The line was very thin; reinforcements,
badly enough wanted, were reported to be coming
up. Meanwhile the battalion could only hope that
the shells would continue to spare them, and that when
the enemy came the numbers would be sufficiently
even to enable them to put up a good fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Anstruther, white-faced under a bandage
that showed red stains, nodded to them cheerily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ripping morning, isn’t it?” he said. “Hope
you’ve had a pleasant night, Linton!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim grinned, glancing at his hands, which displayed
numerous long red scars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One’s nights here are first-class training for the
career of a burglar later on,” he said. “Mending
barbed-wire in the dark is full of unexpected happenings,
chiefly unpleasant. I don’t mind the actual
mending so much as having to lie flat on one’s face
in the mud when a star-shell comes along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very disorganizing to work,” said another subaltern,
Blake, whose mud-plastered uniform showed
that he had had his share of lying flat. In private
life Blake had belonged to the species “nut,” and had
been wont to parade in Bond Street in beautiful
raiment. Here, dirty, unshaven and scarcely distinguishable
from the muddiest of his platoon, he
permitted himself a cheerfulness that Bond Street had
never seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down,” Anstruther said. “There are more
or less dry sandbags, and business is slack. Why
didn’t you fellows come down to mess? Have you had
any breakfast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, thanks,” Jim answered. “We fed up there—our
men were inclined to give breakfast a miss, so
we encouraged them to eat by feeding largely, among
them. Nothing like exciting a feeling of competition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trenches under fire don’t breed good healthy
appetites—at any rate until you’re used to them,”
Blake remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The men are bucking up well, all the same,” said
Anstruther. “I’m jolly proud of them; it’s a tough
breaking-in for fellows who aren’t much more than
recruits. They’re steadying down better than I could
have hoped they would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t the weary old barrack-square grind stand
to them now!” said Jim. “They see it, too, themselves;
only they’re very keen to put all the bayonet-exercise
into practice. Smith, my servant, was the
mildest little man you ever saw, at home; now he
spends most of the day putting a bloodthirsty edge
on his bayonet, and I catch him in corners prodding the
air and looking an awful Berserk. They’re all chirping
up wonderfully this morning, bless ’em. I shouldn’t
wonder if by this time to-morrow they were regarding
it all as a picnic!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is, if you look at it the right way,” said Blake.
“Lots of jokes about, too. Did you hear what one of
our airmen gave the enemy on April the First? He
flew over a crowd behind their lines, and dropped a
football. It fell slowly, and Brother Boche took to
cover like a rabbit, from all directions. Then it struck
the ground and bounced wildly, finally settling to
rest: I suppose they thought it was a delay-action
fuse, for they laid low for a long time before they dared
believe it was not going to explode. So they came out
from their shelters to examine it, and found written
on it ‘April fool—<span class='it'>Gott strafe England</span>!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hearers gave way to mirth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good man!” said Anstruther. “But there are
lots of mad wags among the flying people. I should
think it must make ’em extraordinarily cheerful always
to be cutting about in nice clean air, where there
isn’t any barbed-wire or mud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Feeling grunts came from the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather!” said Garrett, another veteran of eight
months’ service. “There was one poor chap who
had engine-trouble when he was doing a lone reconnaissance,
and had to come down behind the German
lines. He worked furiously, and just got his machine
in going order, when two enemy officers trotted up,
armed with revolvers, and took him prisoner. Then
they thought it would be a bright idea to make him
take <span class='it'>them</span> on a reconnaissance over the Allied lines;
which design they explained to him in broken English
and with a fine display of their portable artillery,
making him understand that if he didn’t obey he’d be
shot forthwith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he didn’t!” Wally burst out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just you wait, young Australia—you’re an awful
fire-eater!” said the narrator. “The airman thought
it over, and came to the conclusion that it would be a
pity to waste his valuable life; so he gave in meekly,
climbed in, and took his passengers aboard. They
went off very gaily, and he gave them a first-rate
view of all they wanted to see; and, of course, carrying
our colours, he could fly much lower than any German
machine could have gone in safety. It was jam for
the two Boches; I guess they felt their Iron Crosses
sprouting. Their joy only ended—and then it ended
suddenly—when he looped the loop!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The audience jumped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They very naturally fell out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the airman?” Wally asked, ecstatically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had taken the precaution to strap himself in—unobtrusively.
Didn’t I tell you he appreciated his
valuable life?” said Garrett, laughing. “He came
down neatly where he wanted to, made his report,
and sent out a party to give decent burial to two very
dead amateur aviators. The force of gravity is an
excellent thing to back you up in a tight place, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s something to get one’s chance—and it’s
quite another to know when to take advantage of it,”
said Anstruther. “I expect an airman has to learn
to make up his mind quicker than most of us. But
there’s no doubt of the chances that come to some
people. A Staff officer was here early this morning,
and he was telling me of young Goujon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s he?” queried Blake, lazily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a French kid—just seventeen. He was one
of a small party sent out to locate some enemy machine-guns
that were giving a good deal of trouble. They
found ’em, all right; but when they were wriggling
their way back a shell came along and wiped out the
entire crowd—all except this Goujon kid. He was
untouched, and he hid for hours in the crater made
by the explosion of the shell. When it got dark he
crept out: but by that time he was pretty mad, and
instead of getting home, he wanted to get a bit of his
own back, and what must he do but crawl to those
machine-guns and lob bombs on them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s some kid,” said Blake briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he was, rather. He destroyed two of the
three guns, and then was overpowered—<span class='it'>that</span> wouldn’t
have taken long!—and made prisoner: pretty roughly
handled, too. But before he could be sent to the
rear, some of our chaps made a little night-attack on
that bit of German trench, and in the excitement
Goujon got away. So he trotted home—but on the
way he stopped, and gathered up the remaining
machine-gun. Staggered into his own lines with it.
They’ve given him the Military Medal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deserved it, too,” was the comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he’s seventeen!” said some one. “He ought
to get pretty high up before the war is over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know a man who’s a major at nineteen,” Anstruther
said, “Went out as a second lieutenant and
was promoted for gallantry at Mons; got his captaincy
and was wounded at the Aisne; recovered, and at
Neuve Chapelle was the sole officer left, except two
very junior subalterns, in all his battalion. He handled
it in action, brought them out brilliantly—awful corner
it was, too,—and was in command for a fortnight
after, before they could find a senior man; there
weren’t any to spare. He was gazetted major last
week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucky dog!” said Blake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I suppose he is. They say he’s a genius
at soldiering, anyhow; and, of course, he got his chance.
There must be hundreds of men who would do as
well if they ever got it; only opportunity doesn’t
come their way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say this will be a war for young men,” Garrett
said. “We’re going back to old days; I believe
Wellington and Napoleon were colonels at twenty.
And that’s more than you will be, young Meadows,
if you don’t mend your ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never expected to be,” said Wally, thus attacked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why won’t I, anyhow, apart from obvious
reasons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you’ll be a neat little corpse,” said Garrett.
“What’s this game of yours I hear about?—crawling
round on No-Man’s Land at night, and
collecting little souvenirs? The souvenir you’ll certainly
collect will come from a machine-gun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally blushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there are such a jolly lot of things there,”
he defended himself. “Boche helmets—I’ve got three
beauties—and belts, and buckles, and things. People
at home like ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Presumably people at home like you,” Anstruther
said. “But they certainly won’t have you to like
if you do it, and it’s possible their affection might
even wane for a German helmet that had cost you
your scalp. <span class='it'>Verboten</span>, Meadows; that’s good German,
at any rate. Understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally assented meekly. Jim Linton, apparently
sublimely unconscious of the conversation, sighed
with relief. His chum’s adventurous expeditions had
caused him no little anxiety, especially as they were
undertaken at a time when his own duties prevented
his keeping an eye on the younger boy—which would
probably have ended in his accompanying him. From
childhood, Jim and Wally had been accustomed to do
things in pairs: a habit which had persisted even
to sending them together from Australia to join the
Army, since Wally was too young for the Australian
forces. England was willing to take boys of seventeen;
therefore it was manifestly out of the question
that Jim should join anywhere but in England, despite
his nineteen years. And as Jim’s father and sister
were also willing to come to England, the matter had
arranged itself as a family affair. Wally Meadows was
an orphan, and the Linton family had long included
him on a permanent, if informal, basis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s jolly to get V.C.’s and medals and other ironmongery,”
Anstruther was saying; “but I’d like to be
the chap who organized the Toy Band on the retreat
from Mons. He was a Staff officer, and he found
the remains of a regiment, several hundred strong,
straggling through a village, just dead beat. The
Germans were close on their heels; the British had
no officers left, and had quite given up. The Staff
chap called on them to make another effort to save
themselves, but they wouldn’t—they had been on
the run for days, were half-starved, worn out: they
didn’t care what happened to them. The officer was
at his wits’ end what to do, when his eye fell on a little
bit of a shop—you know the usual French village
store, with all sorts of stuff in the window: and there
he saw some toy drums and penny whistles. He
darted in and bought some: came out and induced
two or three of the less exhausted men to play them—it’s
said he piped on one penny whistle himself, only
he won’t admit it now. But you know what the tap
of a drum will do on a route-march when the men
are getting tired. He roused the whole regiment with
his fourpence-worth of band and brought them back
to their brigade next day—never lost a man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jolly good work,” said Blake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t get anything for it, of course,” said
Anstruther. “You don’t get medals for playing tin
whistles; and anyhow, there was no one to report it.
But—yes, I’d like to have been that chap.” He rose
and stretched himself, taking advantage of a section
of undamaged parapet. “Brother Boche is rather
late in beginning his hate this morning, don’t you
think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps he’s given up hating as a bad job,” Wally
suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll miss the dear old thing if he really means
to leave us alone,” said Anstruther. “Just as well
if he does, though: our line is painfully thin, and it’s
evident to anyone that our guns are short of ammunition:
we’re giving them about one shell to twenty
of theirs. And don’t they know it! They send us
enormous doses of high-explosive shells, and in return
we tickle them feebly with a little shrapnel. They
must chuckle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose England will wake up and make munitions
for us when we’re all wiped out,” said Garrett,
scornfully. “They’re awfully cheery over there:
theatres and restaurants packed, business as usual,
bull-dog grit, and all the rest of it: Parliament yapping
happily, and strikes twice a week. And our chaps
trying to fight for ’em, and dying for want of ammunition
to do it with. I suppose they think we’re rather
lazy not to make it in our spare time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid they won’t appoint me dictator just
yet,” Blake remarked. “If they would, I’d have
every striker and slacker out here: not to fight, but
to mend barbed-wire, clean up trenches, and do the
general dirty work. First-rate tonic for a disgruntled
mind. And I’d send what was left of them to the end
of the world afterwards. Will you have them in Australia,
Linton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks; we’ve plenty of troubles of our own,”
Jim returned hastily. “Don’t you think we were
dumping-ground for your rubbish for long enough?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were a large, empty place, and you had to be
peopled,” said Blake, grinning. “And a good many
of them were very decent people, I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they might well be,” Jim responded—“you
sent them out for stealing a sheep or a shirt or a medicine-bottle:
one poor kid of six was sent out for life
for stealing jam-tarts. Many excellent men must
have begun life by stealing jam-tarts: I did, myself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’re a sample of the after-effects, I don’t
wonder we exported the other criminals early,” laughed
Blake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if any of their descendants grew into the
chaps that landed at Gallipoli the other day, they were
no bad asset,” said Anstruther. “By Jove, those
fellows must be fighters, Linton! I wouldn’t care
to have the job of holding them back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew they’d fight,” said Jim briefly. Down
in his quiet soul he was torn between utter pride in
his countrymen, and woe that he had not been with
them in that stern Gallipoli landing: the latter emotion
firmly repressed. It had been the fight of his boyish
dreams—wild charging, hand to hand work, a fleeing
enemy: not like this hole-and-corner trench existence
unseen by the unseen foe, with Death that could not
be combated dropping from the sky. His old school-fellows
had been at Gallipoli, and had “made good.”
He ached to have been with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An orderly came up hurriedly. Anstruther tore
open the note he carried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s word of an enemy attack,” he said crisply.
“Get to your places—quick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subalterns scattered along the trench, each to his
platoon. They had already inspected the men, making
sure that no detail of armament had been forgotten,
and that rifles were all in order. Garrett, who commanded
the machine-gun section, fled joyfully to the
emplacement, his face like a happy child’s. The alarm
ran swiftly up and down the trench: low, sharp words
of command brought every man to his place, while
the sentries, like statues, were glued to their peep-holes.
Jim and Wally fingered their revolvers, scarcely
able to realize that the time for using them had come
at last. Field officers appeared, hurriedly scanning
every detail of preparation, and giving a word of advice
here and there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank ’eving, we’re going to have a look-in!”
muttered a man in front of Jim: a grizzled sergeant
with the two South African ribbons on his breast.
“Steady there, young ’Awkins; don’t go meddlin’
with that trigger of yours. You’ll get a chanst of
loosin’ off pretty soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cawn’t come too soon for me!” said Hawkins,
in a throaty whisper, fondling his rifle lovingly.
“They got me best pal yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then keep your ’ead cool till the time comes to
mention wot you think of ’em,” returned the sergeant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim and Wally found a chink in the sandbag parapet,
and looked out eagerly ahead. All was quiet. The
sparrows, made bold by the extraordinary peace of
the morning, still chirped and twittered on No-Man’s
Land. No sound came from the German trenches
beyond. Here and there a faint smoke-wreath curled
lazily into the air, telling of cooking-fires and breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do they know they’re coming?” Wally whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aeroplane reconnaissance, I suppose,” Jim
answered, pointing to two or three specks floating
in the blue overhead, far out of reach of the anti-aircraft
guns. “They’ve been hovering up there all
the morning. Feeling all right, Wal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fit as a fiddle. I suppose I’ll be in a blue funk
presently, but just now I feel as if I were going to a
picnic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I—and the men are keen as mustard. I
thought little Wilson would be useless; you know
how jumpy he’s been since we came here. But look
at him, there; he’s as steady and cool as any sergeant.
They’re good boys,” said the subaltern, who was not
yet twenty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mind your ’ead, sir!” came in an agonized whisper
from a corporal below; and Jim ducked obediently
under the lee of the parapet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s quite hot,” he said, peering again through
his peep-hole. “There’s a jolly breeze springing up,
though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The breeze came softly over No-Man’s Land, fluttering
the wings of the cheerful sparrows. Across the
scarred strip of grass a low, green cloud wavered upwards.
It grew more solid, spreading in a dense wall
over the parapet of the German trench.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth——?” Jim began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The green cloud seemed to hesitate. Then the
wind freshened a little, and it suddenly blew forward
across No-Man’s Land, growing denser as it came.
Before it, the sparrows fled suddenly, darting to the
upper air with shrill chirpings of alarm. But one bird,
taken unawares, beat his wings wildly for a moment,
flying forward. Then he pitched downwards and
the cloud rolled over him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” uttered Wally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the parapet of the British trench ahead of
them the cloud stood for a moment, and then toppled
bodily into the trench. It fell as water falls like a
heavy thing. From its green depths came hoarse
shouts, and rifles suddenly went off in an irregular
fusillade. Then the cloud rolled over, leaving the
trench full of vapour, and stole towards the second
British line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great cry came ringing down the trench.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gas! It’s their filthy gas!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a new thing, and no one was prepared for it.
Across the Channel, England was shuddering over
the first reports of the asphyxiating gas attacks, and
the women of England were working night and day at
the first half-million respirators to be sent out to the
troops. But to the men in the trenches there had
come only vague rumours of what the French and
Canadians had suffered: and they had been slow to
believe. It was not easy to realize, unseeing, the full
horror of that most malignant device with which
Science had blackened War. A few of the officers had
respirators—dry, and comparatively useless. The men
were utterly unprotected. Like sheep waiting for the
slaughter they stood rigidly at attention, waiting for
the evil green cloud that blew towards them, already
poisoning the clean air with its noxious fumes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tie your handkerchiefs round your mouths and
nostrils!” Jim Linton shouted. “Quick, Wally!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught at the younger boy’s handkerchief and
knotted it swiftly. The corporal shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most of ’em ain’t got no ’ankerchers, sir,” he said
grimly. “They <span class='it'>will</span> clean their rifles with ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came another cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out—they’re coming!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dimly, behind the cloud of gas, they could see
shadowy forms clambering over the parapet of the
enemy trench; German soldiers, unreal and horrible
in their hideous respirators, with great goggle eyes of
talc. Ahead, the quick spit of machine-guns broke
out spitefully; and, as if in answer, Garrett’s Maxims
opened fire. Then the gas was upon them: falling
from above over the parapet, stealing like a live thing
down the communication trench that led from the
first line, where already the Germans were swarming.
Men were choking, gasping, fighting for air; dropping
their rifles as they tore at their collars, losing their
heads altogether in the horror of the silent attack. A
little way down the trench Anstruther was trying to
rally them, his voice only audible for a few yards. Jim
echoed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, boys! it’s better in the open. Let’s get
at them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sprang up over the parapet, Wally at his side.
There were bullets whistling all round them, but the
air was more free—it was Paradise compared to the
agony of suffocation in the trench. Some of the men
followed. Jim leaped back again, dragging at others;
pushing, striking, threatening; anything to get them
up above, where at least they might die fighting, not
like rats in a hole. He was voiceless, inarticulate;
he could only point upwards, and force them over the
parapet and into the bullet-swept space. Wally was
there—was Wally killed? Then he saw him beside
him in the trench, dragging at little Private Wilson,
who had fallen senseless. Together they lifted him
and flung him out at the rear, turning to fight with
other men who had given up and were leaning against
the walls, choking. Above them Anstruther was
getting the men into some semblance of formation to
meet the oncoming rush of Germans. He called to
them sharply, authoritatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Linton!—Meadows! Come out at once!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim tried to obey. Then he saw that Wally was
staggering, and flung his arm round him; but the
arm was suddenly limp and helpless, and Wally pitched
forward on his face and lay still, gasping. Jim tried
to drag him up, fighting with the powerlessness that
was creeping over him. Behind him the roar of
artillery grew faint in his ears and died away, though
still he seemed to hear the steady spit of Garrett’s
machine-guns. He sagged downwards. Then black,
choking darkness rushed upon him, and he fell across
the body of his friend.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE lift came gliding on its upward journey in a
big London hotel, far too slowly for the impatience
of its only passenger, a tall girl of sixteen, with
a mop of brown curls, and grey eyes alight with excitement.
Ordinarily, Norah Linton was rather pale,
especially in London, where the air is largely composed
of smoke, and has been breathed in and out of a great
number of people until it is nearly worn out; but just
now there was a scarlet spot on each cheek, and her
mouth broke into smiles as though it could not help
itself. At Floor No. 4, a fat old lady threatened to stop
the lift, but decided at the last moment that she
preferred to walk upstairs. At No. 5, no one was in
sight, and Norah sighed with audible relief, and ejaculated,
“Thank goodness!” At No. 6, two men were
seen hurrying along the corridor some distance away,
and shouting, “Lift!” But at this point the lift-boy,
to whom Norah’s impatience had communicated itself,
behaved like Nelson when he applied his telescope to
his blind eye, and shot upwards, disregarding the
shouts of his would-be passengers; and, passing by
No. 7 as though it were not there, brought the lift to
an abrupt halt at No. 8, flinging the door open with a
rattle and a triumphant, “There y’are, miss!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you!” said Norah, flashing at him a grateful
smile that sent the lift-boy earthwards in a state of
mind that made him loftily oblivious of the reproaches
of neglected passengers. She was out of the lift with a
quick movement, and in the empty corridor broke into
a run. Her flying feet carried her swiftly to a sitting-room
some distance away, and she burst in like a
whirlwind. “Dad! Daddy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no one there, and with an exclamation
of impatience she turned and ran once more, far too
excited now to care whether any Londoners were there
to be shocked at the spectacle of a daughter of Australia
racing along an hotel corridor. She had not far to go;
a turn brought her face to face with a tall man, lean
and grizzled, who cast a glance at her that took in the
crumpled yellow envelope in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one with a soldier son looked calmly on telegrams
in those days, and David Linton’s face changed
abruptly. “What is it, Norah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re coming,” said Norah, and suddenly found
a huge lump in her throat that would not go away.
She put out a hand and clung to her father’s coat.
“They’re truly coming, daddy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father’s voice was not as steady as usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, they must be. It says ‘Better—London
to-morrow.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better?” mused Mr. Linton. “I wonder if that
means hospital or us, Norah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah’s face fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it may be hospital,” she said. “It was
so lovely to think they were coming that I nearly
forgot that part of it. Can we find out, daddy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll go and try,” Mr. Linton said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now?” said Norah, and jigged on one foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get my hat,” said her father, departing with a
step not so unlike his daughter’s. Norah waited in
the corridor for a few minutes, and then, impatient
beyond the possibility of further waiting in silence,
followed him to his room, there finding him endeavouring
to remove London mud-stains from a trouser-leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might think when you’ve managed to brush
it off that it had gone—but indeed it hasn’t,” said
David Linton, wrathfully regarding gruesome stains
and brushing them with a vigour that should have been
productive of better results.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does cling,” remarked Norah, comprehendingly.
“I’ll sponge it for you, daddy; those stains never yield
to mild measures. Daddy, do you think they’ll be
long getting better?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anyone else might have been excused for thinking
she meant the mud-stains. But David Linton made
no such mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” he said slowly. “One hears such
different stories about that filthy German gas. It all
depends on the size of the dose they got, I fancy. Jim
said it was mild; but then Jim would say a good deal
to avoid frightening us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he was able to write. But Wally hasn’t
written.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; and that doesn’t look well. He’s such a
good lad—it’s quite likely he’d write and let us know
all he could about Jim. But I don’t fancy the doctors
would let them travel unless they were pretty well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose not. Oh, doesn’t it seem ages until
to-morrow, dad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll come, if you give it time,” said her father.
“However—yes, it does seem a pretty long time,
Norah.” They laughed at each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t do a bit of good for you to put on that
wise air,” Norah said, “because I know exactly how
you feel, and that’s just the same as I do. And anyone
would be the same who had two boys at the Front
like Jim and Wally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think they would,” said her father, abandoning
as untenable the position of age and wisdom. “Thank
goodness they will be back with us to-morrow, at any
rate.” He put his clothes-brush on the table and
stood up, tall and thin and a little grim. “It seems a
long while since they went away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Long!” Norah echoed, expressively. It was in
reality only a month since her brother Jim and his chum
had said good-bye on the platform at Victoria Station;
and in some ways it seemed only a few minutes since
the train had moved slowly out, with the laughing
boyish faces framed in the window. But each slow
day, with its dragging weight of anxiety, had been a
lifetime. To them had come what the whole world
had learned to know; the shiver of fear on opening
the green envelopes from the Front; the racking longing
for the news; the sick dread at the sight of a telegram—even
at the sound of an unusual knock. David
Linton had grown silent and grim; Norah felt an old
woman, and the care-free Australian life which was
all she had known seemed a world away—vanished
as completely as the Australian tan had faded from
her cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it was all over, and for a while, at any rate,
they could forget. Jim had so managed that no shock
came to them—the cheery telegram he had contrived
to send before being taken to hospital had reached them
two days earlier than the curt War Office intimation
that both boys were suffering from gas-poisoning. Jim
did not mean that they should ever know what it had
meant to send it. The cavalry subaltern who had
helped him along to the dressing-station had been very
kind; he had contrived to hear the address, even in
the choked, strangling whisper, which was all the voice
the gas had left to Jim; had even suggested a wording
that would tell without alarming, and had put aside
almost angrily Jim’s struggle to find his money.
“Don’t you worry,” he had said, “it’ll go. I’ve
seen other chaps gassed, and you’ll be all right soon.”
He was a cheery pink and white youngster: Jim was
sorry he had not found out his name. In the hard
days and nights that followed, his face hovered round
his half-conscious dreams—curiously like a little lad
who had fagged for him at school in Melbourne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was two weeks ago, and of those two weeks
Mr. Linton and Norah fortunately knew little. Wally
had been the worst; Jim had been dragged out of
the gassed trench a few minutes earlier than his friend,
and possibly to the younger boy the shock had been
greater. When the first terrible paroxysms passed,
he could only lie motionless, endeavouring to conjure
up a faint ghost of his old smile when Jim’s anxious
face peered at him from the next bed. Neither had
any idea at all of how they had reached the hospital
at Boulogne; all their definite memories ended
abruptly when that evil-smelling green cloud had rolled
like a wave above them into the trench.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of the first dark mist of choking suffering they
had passed slowly into comparative peace, broken now
and then by recurring attacks, but, by contrast, a very
haven of tranquillity. They were very tired and lazy:
it was heavenly to lie there, quite still, and watch the
blue French sky through the window and the kind-faced
nurses flitting about—each doing far too much
for her strength, but always cheery. They did not
want to talk—their voices had gone somewhere very
far off; all they wanted was just to be quiet; not to
move, not to talk, not to cough. Then, as the clean
vigour of their youth reasserted itself, and strength
came back to them, energy woke once more, and with
it their old-time lively hatred of bed. They begged
to be allowed to get up; and as their places were badly
needed for men worse than they, the doctors granted
their prayer—after which they would have been extremely
glad to get back again, only that pride forbade
their admitting it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, there was London; and London, with
all that it meant to them, was worth a struggle. Two
months earlier it had bored them exceedingly, and
nothing had seemed worth while, with the call in
their blood to be out in the trenches. Now, after
actual experience of the trenches, their ideas had
undergone a violent change. The romance of war had
faded utterly. The Flying Corps might retain it still—those
plucky fighting men who soared and circled
overhead, bright specks in the clouds and the blue
sky; but to the men who grubbed underground amid
discomfort, smells, and dirt, to which actual fighting
came as a blessed relief, war had lost all its glamour.
They wanted to see the job through. But London
was coming first, and it had blossomed suddenly into
a paradise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of which Jim had tried to put into his shaky
pencilled notes; and the certainty of their boys’
gladness to get back lay warm at the hearts of Norah
and her father as they walked along Piccadilly. Spring
was in the air: the Park had been full of people, the
Row crowded with happy children, scurrying up and
down the tan on their ponies, with decorous grooms
endeavouring to keep them in sight. The window-boxes
in the clubs were gay with daffodils and hyacinths:
the busy, knowing London sparrows twittered
noisily in the budding trees, making hurried arrangements
for setting up housekeeping in the summer.
Even though war raged so close to England, and its
shadow lay on every hearth, nothing could quite
dim the gladness of London’s awakening to the
Spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those fellows all look so happy,” said Mr. Linton,
indicating a motor-car crammed with wounded men
in their blue hospital suits and scarlet ties. “One
never sees a discontented face among them. I hope
our boys will look as happy, Norah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there is any chance of looking happy, Jim and
Wally will take it!” said Norah, firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think they will,” said her father, laughing. “The
difficulty is to imagine them ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, isn’t it? Do you remember when those
horrid Zulus battered them about so badly in Durban,
how extraordinary it was to see them both in bed,
looking pale?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I think it was the first time it had occurred
to either of them,” said Mr. Linton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose one could never realize the awful effects
of the gas unless one actually saw it,” Norah said.
“But I can’t help feeling glad, if they had to be hurt,
that it was that: not wounds or—crippling.” Her
voice fell on the last word. “I just couldn’t bear the
thought of Jim or Wally being crippled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t!” said her father, sharply. “Please God,
they’ll come out of it without that. And as for the
gas—Jim assured us they would be all right, but I’ll
be glad when I talk to a doctor about them myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inquiries proved disappointing. It was certain
that the boys would not be allowed to return directly
to them. They would travel in hospital trains and a
hospital ship; it was difficult to say where men would
be taken, when so many, broken and helpless, were
being brought to England every day. The Victorian
Agent-General was sympathetic and helpful; he
promised to find out all that could be found from the
overworked authorities, and to let them know at the
earliest possible moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I fancy that long son of yours will find a way
of letting you know himself, Mr. Linton,” he said.
“I’ll do my best—but I wouldn’t mind betting he gets
ahead of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came out of the building that is a kind of oasis
in London to all homesick Victorians, pausing, as they
always did, to look at the exhibits in the outer office—wool
and wheat and timber, big model gold nuggets,
and the shining fruits that spoke of the orchards
on the hillsides at home; with pictures of wide
pastures where sleek cattle stood in the knee-high
grass, or reapers and binders whirred through splendid
crops. It was a little patch of Australia, planted in
the very heart of London; hard to realize that just
outside the swinging glass doors the grey city—history
suddenly become a live thing—stretched away eastward,
and, to the west, the roaring Strand carried its
mighty burden of traffic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll always be glad I had the chance of seeing
London,” said Norah. “But whenever I come here
I know how glad I’ll be to go back!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that without coming here,” said her father,
drily. “It would be jolly if we could take those boys
home to get strong, Norah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Billabong?” said Norah, wistfully. “Oh-h!
But we’ll do it some day, daddy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust so. Won’t there be a scene when we get
back!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I dream about it!” said Norah. “And I
wake up all homesick. Can’t you picture Brownie,
dad!—she’ll have cooked everything any of us ever
liked, and the house will be shining from top to bottom,
and there won’t be a thing different—I know she dusts
your old pipes and Jim’s stockwhips herself every day!
And Murty will have the horses jumping out of their
skins with fitness, and Lee Wing’s garden will be something
marvellous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Billy,” said David Linton, laughing. “Can’t
you see his black face—and his grin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, and the great wide paddocks—the view from
the verandah, across the lagoon and looking right
over the plains! I don’t seem to have looked at anything
far away since we came off the ship,” said Norah;
“all the views are shut in by houses, and the air is so
thick one couldn’t see far, in any case!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They tell me there’s clear air in Ireland,” said her
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I want to go there,” responded his daughter,
promptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—we might do worse than that. I’ve been
thinking a good deal, Norah; if the boys don’t get
well quickly—and I believe few of the gassed men do—we
shall have to take them away somewhere for a
change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” agreed Norah. “We couldn’t keep
them in London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course not. Country air and not too many
people; that is the kind of tonic our boys will want.
What would you think of going to Ireland?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah drew a long breath of delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh-h!” she said. “You do make the most
beautiful plans, daddy! We’ve always wanted to go
there more than anywhere: and war wouldn’t seem
so near to us there, and we could try to make the boys
forget gas and trenches and shells and all sorts of
horrors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just it,” said her father. “The wisest
doctor I ever knew used to say that change of environment
was worth far more than change of air; we
might try to manage both for them, Norah. Donegal
was your mother’s country: I’ve been meaning to go
there. She loved it till the day she died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the tumult of the Strand Norah slipped a hand
into her father’s. Very seldom did he speak of the
one who was always in his memory: the little mother
who had grown tired, and had slipped out of life when
Norah was a baby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go there, daddy,” she begged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll consult the boys,” said Mr. Linton. “Eh,
but it’s good to think we shall have them to consult
with to-morrow! You know, Norah, since Jim left
school, I’ve become so used to consulting him on all
points, that I feel a lost old man without him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll never be old!” said his daughter, indignantly.
“But Jim just loves you to talk to him the
way you do,—I know he does, only, of course, he’s quite
unable to say so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim has lots of sense,” said Jim’s father. “So
has Wally, for that matter: there is plenty of shrewdness
hidden somewhere in that feather-pate of his.
They’re very reliable boys. I was ‘thinking back’
the other night, and I don’t remember ever having
been really angry with Jim in my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think not!” said Norah, regarding him
with wide eyes of amazement. “Why would you be
angry with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I don’t know,” said her father rather helplessly.
“Jim never was a pattern sort of boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but he had sense,” said Norah. She began
to laugh. “Oh, I don’t know how it is,” she said.
“We’ve all been mates always: and mates don’t get
angry with each other, or they wouldn’t be mates.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose that’s it,” Mr. Linton said, accepting
this comprehensive description of a bush family standpoint.
“There’s a ’bus that will go our way, Norah:
I’ve had enough of elbowing my way through this
crowd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They climbed on top of the motor-’bus, and found
the front seat empty; and when Norah was on the
front seat of a ’bus she always felt that it was her own
private equipage and that she owned London. To
their left was the huge yard of Charing Cross Station,
crowded with taxis and cabs and private motors, with
streams of foot passengers pouring in and out of the
gateways. At Charing Cross one may see in five
minutes more foreigners than one meets in many hours
in other parts of London, and this was especially the
case since the outbreak of war. Homesick Belgian
refugees were wont to stray there, to watch the stream
of passengers from the incoming Continental trains,
hoping against hope that they might see some familiar
face. There were soldiers of many nations; unfamiliar
uniforms were dotted throughout the crowd, besides
the khaki that coloured every London street. Even
from the ’bus-top could be heard snatches of talk in
many languages—save only one often heard in former
days: German. A string of recruits, each wearing the
King’s ribbon, swung into the station under a smart
recruiting sergeant: a cheery little band, apparently
relieved that the plunge had at last been taken, and
that they were about to shoulder their share of the
nation’s work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a straight pair of shoulders among the lot,”
remarked Mr. Linton, surveying them critically. “It’s
pleasant to think that very soon they will be almost
as well set up as that fellow in the lead. War is going
to do a big work in straightening English shoulders—morally
and physically.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ’bus gave a violent jerk, after the manner of
’buses in starting, and moved on through the crowded
street, threading its way in and out of the traffic in the
most amazing fashion—finding room to squeeze its
huge bulk through chinks that looked small for a
donkey-cart to pass, and showing an agility in dodging
that would have done credit to a hare. It rocked
on its triumphal way westward: past the crouching
stone lions in Trafalgar Square, where the plinth of the
Nelson Column blazed with recruiting posters; past
the “Orient” offices, with their big pictures of Australian-going
steamers—which made Norah sigh; and
so up to Piccadilly Circus, where they found themselves
packed into a jam of traffic so tight that it seemed that
it could never disentangle. But presently it melted
away, and they went on round the stately curve of
Regent Street, with its glittering shops; and so home to
the hotel—where they had lived so long that it really
seemed almost home—and to their own sitting-room,
gay with daffodils and primroses, and littered with
work. Norah’s knitting—khaki socks and mufflers—lay
here and there, and there was a pile of finished
articles awaiting dispatch to the Red Cross headquarters
in the morning. Under the window, a big,
workmanlike deal table was littered with scraps of
wood, curiously fashioned, with tools in a neat rack.
It was David Linton’s workshop; all the time he
could spare from helping with wounded soldiers went
to the fashioning of splints and crutches for the hospitals,
where so many were needed every day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A yellow envelope was on the table now, lying across
a splint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Duke of Clarence Hospital,” it said; “to-morrow
afternoon.—<span class='sc'>Jim.</span>”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>‟T</span>HEY’RE doing quite well,” the doctor said,
patting Norah benevolently on the shoulder.
He was a plump little man, always busy, always in a
hurry; but David Linton and his daughter had been
regular visitors to the hospital for some time, and he
had a regard for them. (“Sensible people,” he was
wont to say, approvingly: “they don’t talk too much
to patients, and they don’t fuss!”) Now he knew
that war had hit them personally, and he gave them
two of his few spare minutes. “They’re tired, of
course; and you must expect to see them looking
queer. Gas isn’t a beautifier. But they’ll be all
right. Don’t stay too long. Don’t talk war, if you
can keep them off it. And above all, don’t speak
about gas.” He smiled at them both. “Buck them
up, Miss Norah—buck them up!” Some one called
him hurriedly, and he fled. The khaki ambulances
had delivered a heavy load at the hospital that day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a little room off a quiet corridor, the scent of
golden wattle flung a breath of Australia to greet
them, as it had greeted the tired boys when the orderlies
had carried them in hours before. Jim and Wally
smiled at them from their pillows. No one seemed
able to say anything. Afterwards, Norah had a dim
idea that she had kissed Wally as well as Jim. It
did not appear to matter greatly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were white-faced boys, with black shadows
under their eyes; but the old merriment was there.
A great wave of relief swept over Norah and her father.
They had feared they knew not what from this evil
choking enemy: it was sudden happiness to see that
their boys were not so unlike their old selves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had visions of being up to meet you,” said
Jim, keeping a hand on Norah’s, as she perched on
his bed. “But the doctor thought otherwise.
Doctors are awful tyrants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had a good crossing?” David Linton found
words hard—they stuck in his throat as he looked
at his son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes. We didn’t know much about it. The
hospital train runs you almost on to the ship, and the
orderlies have you in a swinging cot before you know
where you are. Same at the other side: those fellows
do know their job,” Jim said, admiringly. “Of
course, you get a little tired of being handled, towards
the finish, and this room—and bed—seemed awfully
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the wattle was ripping,” said Wally. “However
did you manage to get it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It comes from the South of France,” Norah answered.
“There’s quite a lot of it in London; only
they stare at you if you ask for ‘wattle’, and you have
to learn to say ‘mimosa.’ One gets broken into anything.
I’ve learned to say ‘field’ quite naturally
when I’m talking of a paddock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish Murty could hear you,” said Wally solemnly.
Murty O’Toole was head stockman on Billabong, the
home in Australia. He was a very great friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you picture his face!” Norah uttered. “It
would be interesting to watch Murty’s expression if
dad told him to bring in the cattle from the field when
he wanted the bullocks mustered in the home-paddock!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d give me notice,” said Mr. Linton, firmly.
“Neither long service nor affection would keep him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Murty was born in Ireland, though he did
come out to Australia when he was a small boy,” Norah
said. “So he ought not to feel astonished. But the
person I do want to import to England is black Billy.
It’s part of Billy’s principles not to show amazement
at anything, but I don’t think they’d be proof against
a block of traffic in Piccadilly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d only say, ‘Plenty!’ ” said Jim, laughing—“that
is, if he had any speech left. Poor old Billy,
he hates everything but horses, and any motor is a
‘devil-wagon’ to him. A fleet of big red and yellow
’buses would give him nervous prostration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s one thing that would scare him more,”
Mr. Linton said. “Do you remember the day last
winter when we took Norah to Hampton Court, and
you chucked a stone at the Round Pond?” He
laughed, and every one followed his example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the stone ran along tinkling over the top of
the water,” said Norah, recovering. “I never was
so taken aback in my life. And all the small children
and their nursemaids laughed at me. How was I to
know water turned to ice like that? The only frozen
thing I had ever seen was ice-cream in Melbourne!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Billy never saw ice in his life,” said her father.
“He would have thought it very bad magic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d have taken to his heels and made for the
bush,” said Wally, grinning. “Probably he’d have
made himself a boomerang and turned into an up-to-date
black Robin Hood, living on those tame old
Bushy Park deer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With his headquarters in the Hampton Court
Maze!” added Jim. “Wouldn’t it have been an
enormous attraction—the halfpenny papers would have
called it ‘Wild Life in Quiet Places,’ and London
would have run special motor-bus trips to see our
Billy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His laugh ended in a fit of coughing, which left
him trembling. Norah patted him anxiously, watching
him with troubled eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you talk too much, or we’ll get sent away,”
she warned him. “We’ll do the talking—dad and I.
We’ve heaps to tell you: and such jolly plans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have to make haste and get better,” said
Mr. Linton, looking from one white face to the other.
“Then we’re going to take possession of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kitchener will do that, I guess,” said Wally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Kitchener won—not until you’re quite fit.
You’ll be handed over to us, and it will be our job
to get you thoroughly well. And Norah and I have
agreed that it can’t be done in London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we’re all going to Ireland,” said Norah, happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ireland!” Jim uttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. You’re sure to get leave, so that you can
be thoroughly repaired. We’re going to find some
jolly place in Donegal, where it’s quiet and peaceful,
and we’re all going to buy rods and find out how to
catch trout. Brown trout,” said Norah, learnedly.
“We know all about it, because we bought ever so
many guide-books and studied them all last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say!” ejaculated both patients as one man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds rather like Heaven,” said Jim, drawing
a long breath. “Do you really think it can be managed,
dad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why not,” said his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must get back to our job as soon as we can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly you must. But there’s no sense in your
going back until you are perfectly fit. They wouldn’t
want you. And though you were not as badly gassed
as many—thank goodness!—and your recovery won’t
be such a trying matter as if you had had a bigger dose,
every one agrees that gas takes its time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t wonder,” Jim said, grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That being so, London does not strike me as a
good place for convalescents,” said Mr. Linton. “Pure
air is what you’ll need; and that is not the fine, solid,
grey variety of atmosphere you get here. And Zeppelins
will be happening along freely, once they feel at
home on the track to England. I don’t believe they
will limit their raids to London. The big manufacturing
towns will come in for a share of their attention
sooner or later; and they won’t spare the country places
over which they fly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not they!” said Wally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, all things considered, I think you would be
better in Ireland. I believe it’s peaceful there, if
you don’t talk politics. We don’t want any adventures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve had quite enough since we left Billabong,”
said Norah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear, hear!” said Wally. “I guess the calm
peace of a bog in Ireland is just about our form until
we’re ready to go back and take our turn at strafing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then that’s settled—if the doctors will back me
up,” Mr. Linton said. “Just as soon as they will let
you we’ll pack up the fewest possible clothes and set
out for a sleepy holiday in Ireland: trout-fishing, old
ruins, bogs, heather, and no adventures at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later on, they were to recall this peaceful forecast
with amazement. At present it seemed a
dream of everything the heart could desire; they
fell into a happy discussion of ways and means, of the
best places to buy fishing-tackle, of the clothes demanded
by bogs and heathery mountains; until a
nurse arrived with tea, and a warning word that the
patients had talked nearly enough. At which the
patients waxed indignant, declaring that their visitors
had only been with them about ten minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten minutes!” said the nurse, round-eyed.
“Over an hour—and doctor’s orders were——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never you mind the doctor’s orders,” Jim said
solemnly. “Doctors don’t know everything. Why,
in Boulogne——” He broke off, assuming an air of
meek unconsciousness of debate as the doctor himself
appeared suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon,” said the doctor, transfixing
patients with an eagle glance, while the nurse
made an unobtrusive escape. “You were saying
something about doctors, I think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, I assure you, sir,” said Jim, grinning
widely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doctors—and Boulogne,” repeated the new-comer,
firmly. “Don’t let me interrupt you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir. Certainly not,” said Jim. “The doctors
in Boulogne are very hard-worked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m!” said his medical attendant, receiving this
piece of information with the suspicion it merited.
“Quite so. We’re all hard-worked, these times,
chiefly with looking after bad boys who ought to be
back at school, getting swished. It’s an awful fate for
a respectable M.D.” He gazed severely at the cheerful
faces on the pillows. “You ought to be asleep; and
of course you are not. Is this a hospital ward, or an
Australian picnic?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Both,” said Wally, laughing. “Don’t be
rough on us, doctor; it isn’t every day we kill a
pig!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor stared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You put things pleasantly!” he said. “It seems
to me that the pigs were trying to kill you: but you’re
all extraordinarily cheerful about it. Now, where’s
Miss Norah gone? I never saw such a girl—she moves
like quicksilver!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah returned, bearing a spare cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do have some tea, doctor,” she begged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t time, but I will,” said the doctor, abandoning
professional cares, and sitting down. “One’s
life is all topsy-turvy nowadays. A year ago I would
not have dreamed of having tea in a patient’s bedroom—let
alone two patients—but then, a year ago I
was practising in Harley Street, developing a sweet,
bedside manner and the figure of an alderman. Today
I’m a semi-military hack, with no manner at all,
and my patients chaff me—actually chaff me, Miss
Norah! It’s very distressing to one’s inherited
notions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be,” said Norah, deeply sympathetic.
“The cake is quite good, doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is,” agreed the doctor, accepting some. “Occasionally
I find a pompous old colonel or brigadier among
my patients, and we exchange soothing confidences
about the terrible future of the medical profession
and the Army. That helps; but then I come back to
the long procession of the foolish subalterns who go
out to Flanders without ever having learned to
dodge!” His eye twinkled as he glared at Jim and
Wally. Norah, whose visits to wounded soldiers
during many weeks had taught her something beyond
his reputation as the most skilful and most merciful
of surgeons, listened unmoved and offered him more
tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no good trying to impress you!” said the
doctor, surrendering his cup. “Thank you, I will
have some more—in pure kindness of heart towards
you, Miss Norah, since, when I leave this room, all
visitors go with me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Norah. “I’ll get some fresh tea,
doctor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not,” said the doctor, severely. “The
picnic is nearly at an end: you can have another
to-morrow, if you’re good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When can we remove the patients, doctor?”
asked Mr. Linton, who had been sitting in amused
silence. A great contentment had settled on his face:
already the lines of anxiety were smoothed away. He
did not want to talk; it was sufficient to sit and watch
Jim, occasionally meeting his eyes with a half-smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remove the patients—Good gracious!” ejaculated
the doctor. “Why they’ve only just been removed
once! Can’t you let them settle down a
little?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We want to take them to Ireland,” said Norah,
eagerly. “Can we, doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m,” said the doctor, reflectively. “There might
be worse plans. We’ll see. Ireland: that’s the place
where the motto is, ‘When you see a head, hit it!’
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think it’s universal,” said Mr. Linton
mildly. “It’s really much more peaceful than English
legends would lead you to believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Between you and me, what the average Englishmen
knows of Ireland might, I believe, he put into one’s
eye without inconvenience,” affirmed the doctor.
“I’m a Scot, and I don’t mind admitting I don’t know
anything. But no Englishman tells an Irish story
without making his speakers say ‘Bedad!’ and
‘Begorra!’ in turn: and I’ve known a heap of
Irishmen, and their conversation was singularly free
from those remarks. I have an inward conviction
that the English-made Irishman doesn’t exist; only
I never have time to verify any of my inward convictions.
And perhaps that’s as well, because then they
never lose weight! Have I drunk all the tea, Miss
Norah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid so,” said Norah, tilting the teapot
regretfully and without success. “Do let me get
you some more. I know quite well where they make
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to!” said the doctor, rising. “Don’t tempt
an honest man from the path of duty. I’m off—and I
give you three minutes. Then the patients are to
compose themselves to slumber.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Ireland, doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ireland?” said the doctor, pausing in the doorway.
“Oh, there’s lots of time to think about that
distressful country.” He relented a little, looking at
the eager faces. “Very possibly. We’ll re-open the
discussion this day week. Three minutes, mind.
Good-bye.” His quick steps died away along the
corridor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later Wally wriggled on his pillow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Asleep, Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—not quite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you know something? Your people were here
quite a while. And they never said one word about
gas or war or any silly rot like that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Jim, drowsily. “Bricks, weren’t they?
Go to sleep.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>OLYHEAD pier was in the state of wild turmoil
that seethes between the arrival of the
mail and its transhipping to the Dublin boat. Passengers
ran hither and thither, distractedly seeking
luggage, while stolid English porters lent a deaf ear
to their complainings or assured them absent-mindedly
that everything would be all right on the other side;
an assurance always given light-heartedly by the
porter who is comfortably certain of the fact that,
whatever happens on the other side, he will not be
there. First and third class passengers mingled
inextricably in the luggage-hunt, with equal lack of
success, and divided into two streams when the whistle
blew an impatient summons, seeking their respective
gangways under the guiding shouts of officials on the
upper deck. Through the crowd ploughed the mail
trollies, regarding first and third class travellers alike
as mere obstructors of His Majesty’s business, and
asserting their right-of-way by sheer weight and
impetus. Overhead, a grey sky hung darkly, and was
reflected in a grey, white-flecked sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not the usual Ireland-bound crowd of early
summer. Comparatively few women were travelling,
and except for a few elderly men, there was an entire
absence of the knickerbocker-suited, tweed-capped
travellers, with golf-clubs and rod-boxes, who make a
yearly pilgrimage across the Irish Sea. Most of them
were in Flanders or Gallipoli now, and khaki had
replaced the rough tweeds; many would never come
again. In their stead, khaki sprinkled the crowd
thickly. A big detachment of soldiers returning after
furlough, crowded the boat for’ard. Officers in heavy
great-coats were everywhere; one chubby subaltern
in charge of a regimental band, which had been assisting
in a recruiting tour in Wales. A small group surrounded
a tall old general, whose great-coat showed
the crossed sword and baton, while his gold-laced and
red-banded cap made him the object of awed glances
from junior officers, who forthwith put as much of
the ship as possible between themselves and his eagle
eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim Linton and Wally Meadows were among the
first out of the train. It was Jim’s way to let a crowd
disperse a little before he attempted to reach a given
point. “You get there just as quickly, and it saves
an awful lot of pushing and shoving,” he said. But
Wally’s impatience never brooked any such delay; at
all times he found it difficult to sit still, and once movement
was permitted him, he was wont, as Jim further
said, “to run three ways at once.” Therefore, Jim
being too peaceably inclined to argue the matter, they
made a hurried descent to the platform, collected
hand-luggage hastily, discovered a porter, assisted
Mr. Linton and Norah to alight, and had marshalled
their forces on the upper deck of the steamer while yet
the main body of the passengers strove agonizedly to
find their belongings. Then Jim made a leisurely
inspection, discovered their heavy luggage in perfect
safety, duly embarked: and rejoined his party with
the calm certainty of all being right with the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>People were disposing themselves after the varied
fashion of ’cross-Channel passengers. Apprehensive
ladies and a few men cast a despondent look at the
grey sea and the white horses tumbling off-shore, and
prudently sought the shelter of the cabins, hoping, by
prompt lying down, to cheat the demon of sea-sickness.
More seasoned travellers selected chairs on the main
decks, pitched them where any gleams of sun might
reach them, and settled down, rolled in rugs, to read
through the boredom of the passage. On the railings,
small boys perched themselves with the fell determination
of small boys all the world over, while anxious
mothers rent the air with fruitless appeals for them to
come down, and wrathful fathers emphasized the
commands with blows, or else smoked stolidly in the
conviction that a small boy who was meant to fall in
the sea would certainly fall there, in spite of his parents.
Babies wailed dismally, until borne off to the cabin by
mothers and nurses; sirens rent the air with hoarse
shrieks; cranes, loading luggage, rattled and banged,
and above their din rose the shouts of newsboys
hawking London and Dublin papers. Every hand on
the ship was working furiously, for the mail has no
time to spare, and nothing matters to it but the time-table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were off presently, slipping away almost
imperceptibly from the wharf, and nosing out to sea
through the grey waves. The ship thrust her bow
into them doggedly. The mail-boat’s line is a straight
line, and she takes no account of the foaming billows
and the anguish of passengers, thrusting through
everything from port to port. Several people who
had settled down on deck more in hope than certainty
cast sad glances on the sea, and disappeared hurriedly
below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim and Wally turned up their coat-collars as the
breeze freshened, and stood swaying easily to the
motion of the ship. They still bore traces of the
ordeal they had undergone in the trenches; each
was unnaturally pale and heavy-eyed, and recurring
attacks of throat-trouble had kept them from regaining
full strength. Wally’s eyes, too, were weak: he was
under orders to rest them altogether, and was therefore
openly jubilant because he could not read war news—which,
as he said, was one of the most wearying occupations,
only you couldn’t cease doing it without a
decent excuse. “Vetted” by a Medical Board, the
pair had been given six weeks’ leave, at the end of
which time they were to report progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the nerve-disorder which so frequently follows
in the track of gas-poisoning they were fortunately
entirely free. Possibly their dose had not been large
enough: or their clean youth and perfect health had
helped them to throw off the effects felt heavily by
older men. They could joke about it now, and their
longing to get “some of their own back” was so keen
as almost to discount an Irish holiday. Still, war
was likely to last long enough to give them all the
fighting they needed: there was, after all, no immediate
hurry. And it was glorious to feel strength returning:
and the new fishing-rods and tackle bore fascinating
promise, while Ireland itself was a country of
their dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Mr. Linton and Norah, they looked after the
boys unceasingly, fed them at alarmingly short intervals,
and in general manifested so subservient a desire to
run all their errands that the victims revolted, declaring
they were patients no longer, and threatening severe
measures if they were not restored to independence.
Norah and her father submitted unwillingly. To
nurse trench-worn warriors had the double effect of
being in itself comforting, while, so long as the nursing
lasted, the warriors could not possibly consider returning
to the trenches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They looked about them as the swift steamer raced
westward. Soldiers, soldiers everywhere; every likely
youngster was in uniform, and there were many older
men whose keen, quiet faces bore the ineffaceable
stamp of the regular officer of the old Army—the old
Army that was gone for ever, only a fragment left
after the first fierce onslaught of war. The men for’ard
were laughing and singing, just as they laughed and
sang in the trenches; a cornet-player belonging to the
band had found his instrument and was leading the
tune. Near Norah, three or four nuns, sweet-faced
and grave, were seated, evidently enjoying the keen
wind that swept into their faces. There was the usual
sprinkling of passengers, some mere heaps of rugs in
deck-chairs, others walking briskly up and down.
Somewhat apart, a tall old priest stood by the rail,
looking ahead: a gaunt old man with burning, dark
eyes, that searched the grey sea and sky wistfully, as
if looking for the land to which they were hastening.
Jim, strolling backwards and forwards, came presently
to a standstill near him, and asked a question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know what time we get in, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis about three hours, I believe—that or less,”
said the old man, courteously. He turned a steady
glance on Jim, and apparently approved of him, for
he smiled. “Do you not know Ireland, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim shook his head. “It’s my first visit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So?” The old eyes looked ahead once more.
“They take under three hours now to cross; ’twas
many more last time I came away—the bitter day!”
he added, half under his breath. “And that’s three-and-forty
years ago, my son!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! and you’ve never been back, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never. I’ve been in America. A good country;
but it never lets you go, and it never gets to be home.
All that three-and-forty years I’ve been thinking of
the day I’d be going back again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it’s come,” said Jim, his smile suddenly
lighting his grey eyes. The old man smiled back</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you weren’t so young I’d say you knew what
it was to be homesick,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I come from Australia,” said Jim, briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, well!” the priest said. “There’s
another great country—only so far away. There’s
many a good Irishman there, they tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any number of them,” said Jim. “We’ve got
one of the best on our place—Murty O’Toole. He
taught me to ride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he so? There were O’Tooles in Wicklow when
I was a boy; but sure and they’re all over the world.
You’ll be glad to go back, when the time comes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad!” said Jim, explosively. He laughed.
“It’s very jolly, of course, to visit other places. But
home’s home, isn’t it, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye,” said the old man. He looked ahead, his
eyes misty. “Three-and-forty years I’ve dreamed of
it; and now I’m waiting to see the hills of Ireland
coming out of the sea, and this last hour seems longer
than all the years. Well, well; and they’re all dead,
all the people I knew; and I going home to die, like a
wornout old dog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll live in Ireland many a year yet, sir,” Jim
told him, quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no; I’m done. ’Tis my heart, and it finished—sure,
wouldn’t forty years of work in New York finish
any heart!” said the old man, laughing. “But I’m
lucky to be getting back to Ireland to die. Did you
ever hear, now, of the Sons of Tuireann?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim shook his head. “I’m afraid not, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were great fighting men, and they had great
hardship,” said the priest: “and at the end of all
things they were on the sea coming home, dying. And
one of them cried out that he saw the hills of home.
And the others said, ‘Raise up our heads on your
breast till we see Ireland again: and life or death will
be the same to us after that.’ So they died. That
was a good ending. A man wouldn’t ask better.
’Tis a hard thing, dying in a strange country, but you’d
go very easy, once you got home.” He spoke half to
himself, so low that the boy hardly caught the words.
They stood silently for awhile, looking ahead across
the tumbling sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had no right to be talking to you about dying,”
the old priest said presently, turning to Jim with a
smile that made his face extraordinarily child-like.
“Old men get foolish; and my heart’s too big for my
body this day, and I getting home. Tell me now—are
ye Irish, at all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother was Irish,” Jim answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d have said so. What part might she have come
from?—and is she with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She died when I was a kiddie,” Jim answered.
“She came from Donegal. Father says she always
loved it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well! Wherever you’re born, you love
that place. But I think the love for Ireland is beyond
most things. The people leave it because there’s no
room for them and no money; but no matter where
they go they leave the half of their hearts behind.
And they put something of the love into their children
no matter where they’re born, so that they always want
to come and see Ireland: and when they come, ’tis no
strange place to them; they feel they’ve come home.
You’ll feel it—for all that you love that big young
country of yours, and want to get back to her. But
every old ruin, and every bit of brown bog and heathery
mountain, and every little stony field, will say something
to you that you will not be able to put into words:
and when you go back you will not forget. There,
there! I’m talking again!” said the old man; “and
to a boy with business of his own. Tell me, now, have
you been out across yonder yet?” He nodded in the
direction of Flanders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked of war, the priest nodding vehemently
and punctuating Jim’s brief sentences with exclamations
of “Well, well!” The wistfulness dropped from
him suddenly; he was a fighting man, a Crusader—with
a young man’s burning desire to be out in the
trenches, and a young man’s keenness to hear details
of battle. “There’s fifty thousand French priests
fighting for France,” he said, enviously: “none the
worse soldiers for being priests, I’ll vow, and they’ll
be all the better priests afterwards for having been
soldiers! If I were young! if I were young!” He
laughed at his own vehemence. “It’s your day,” he
said; “a great world just now for young men. And
they tell me there’s any number of them out of khaki
yet—standing behind counters and selling lace and
ribbons; and some of them doing women’s
hair! More shame for the women that let
them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If a man wants to stay out of the game and do
women’s work, well that’s all he’s fit for,” said Jim,
slowly. “He’s not wanted where there’s work going.
But he ought to have some sort of a brand put on him,
so that people will be able to tell him from a man in
future!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest chuckled appreciatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Petticoats are the brand he wants,” said he.
“And an extra tax put on him, to support the widows
and children of the men who were men—who went
and fought to save his worthless hide. ’Tis a shame,
now, they wouldn’t make him pay some way. Well,
they wouldn’t have me in the trenches—and it’s good
sense they have; but for all I’m a broken-down old
ruin I’m going fighting—fighting with my tongue
against the boys that stay at home. Perhaps they
don’t realize—the young ones: they might listen to
an old man that was a priest. Just a few days to rest
and feel I’m home at last, and I’m going to do my bit
as a recruiting sergeant!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good luck!” Jim said, heartily. “Only don’t
get knocked up, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis only once a man can die,” he said, cheerfully.
“I’d die easier knowing I’d done my bit, as you boys
say. But I’m in dread I’ll lose my temper with them,
especially if I meet the lads that dress heads of hair!
They wash them too, I’m told. Well, well, it’s a queer
world!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally came up, faintly indignant at Jim’s lengthy
absence, and joined in the talk: and presently Mr.
Linton and Norah followed, and made friends with the
old man. He was such a simple, cheery old man: it
was easy to be friends with him. They grew merry
over queer stories from many countries, and often the
priest’s laugh rang out like a boy’s, while his own
stories brought peals of mirth from his new friends.
But through it all his dark eyes kept searching ahead:
ever looking, looking till the hills of Ireland should
lift from the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They tell me you have big trees in that Australia
of yours,” he said. “Tell me now, are they as big as
the Califorian redwoods?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know the redwoods,” Wally answered
solemnly. “But ours are big. There’s a story of
twelve men who started with axes and cross-cut saws
to get a gum-tree down. They worked on one side for
nine months and then they got bored with that, and
they packed up and made a journey round to the
other side. And there they found a party of fifteen
men who’d been working at that side for a year, and
they were very surprised——” Laughter overcame
him suddenly at the sight of the priest’s amazed face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You young rascal!” said he, joining in the laugh
against himself. “And I taking it all in so meekly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might go on, if you liked, sir, and tell you the
story of the man who was out in the bush bringing
home some calves,” said Wally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t spare me,” begged his hearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he found his way blocked by a fallen tree,
too big to get the calves over. So he started to drive
them along it, to get round. When he didn’t come
home they came to the conclusion that he had stolen
the calves; and so they had to apologize to him, later
on, when he turned up with a nice lot of bullocks.
He said proudly that he hadn’t lost one, only they had
grown up while they were on the journey!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was a long tree!” said the priest, between
chuckles. “Well, well, it must be a great country
that will grow such timber—and such stories, and the
boys to tell them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ought to beg your pardon, sir,” he said. “Only
no good Australian can resist telling tall stories about
his tall trees. But I can tell you a true one of a tree
I knew where seven men camped in the hollow butt.
They had bunks built inside, all round it, and a table
in the middle, and of course, space for a doorway.
That tree was over fifty-five feet inside, and goodness
only knows what it was outside, buttresses and all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it’s true, I suppose, that you could drive a
coach-and-four through a tree?” the priest asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Driving a coach-and-four through the hollowed-out
stump of a tree used to be common enough with us,”
said Jim. “Not that the four horses mattered: you
might as well say ‘and twelve’; it was the width high
enough up to take the top of the coach that meant a
really big tree. It was easier to make a hollow shell
fit for the passage of the coach than to get the whole
tree cut down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so—quite so,” said the priest. “And I’ve
read of church services being held in a hollow tree, in
your country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather. We know one that held twenty-two
people. It was in a wild part of the bush, and whatever
clergyman came along used to use it—Roman
Catholic, Protestant, Presbyterian or Baptist; it
didn’t matter. Every one used to roll up, for it wasn’t
often there was a chance of a church service. There
were lots of jobs for the travelling parson, too: all
the accumulated weddings and christenings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you tell me!” said the priest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother had three children before ever a chance
came of a baptism,” said Mr. Linton. “Then the
three were done together. I was the eldest, and I
remember being extremely indignant about it—I was
four years old, and it was winter, and the water was
cold! It was a standing joke against me afterwards
that I had behaved so much worse than my small
brother and sister.” He laughed, and then grew
grave. “Poor bush mothers! they didn’t have an
easy time. Two of my mother’s babies died without
ever having seen a clergyman; to the end of her life
she worried about the little souls that had gone out
unbaptized.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was themselves needed great hearts—those
pioneer women,” said the priest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They did; and mostly they had great hearts.
But then I think most women have, if the need really
comes,” Mr. Linton said. “Thousands of them were
delicate, tenderly-reared women, with no experience
of bush conditions in a new country; but they made
good. Women have a curious way of finding themselves
able to tackle any conditions with which they
are actually faced. My mother never was strong, and
she had no training for work; I expect she was something
of a butterfly until she married my father and
went off into the Never-Never. She ended by being
a kind of oracle for fifty miles round; people used to
send for her at all hours of the day or night, in sickness,
and she developed a business capacity better
than my father’s. I remember her as a little, merry
thing: always tired, but never too tired to work for
other people. She was only one of thousands of women
doing the same thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the process of learning must have been hard,”
said the old priest, pityingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It must have been a tough apprenticeship.
My mother told me she used to sit down and cry often
at the loneliness and strangeness of it all—in the long
days when all the men were miles away from the
homestead, and she was alone, with the chance of bush
fires and bushrangers and wild blacks. That was until
the babies came. After that there was no time to
cry—which, she said, was a very good thing for her.
Poor little mother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sighed; and in the silence that followed a slight
commotion was audible on the bridge. The priest
glanced up sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing—but that cruel business of the <span class='it'>Lusitania</span>
makes everyone suspicious at sea, nowadays,” he said.
“Still, the Germans may be active enough in the
south, but I don’t fancy they’ll come into these landlocked
waters. Too much risk from our destroyers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah was leaning over the rail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that thing?” she said, slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their eyes followed the direction of her pointing
finger. Nearly astern, a slender grey object bobbed
among the waves: so small a thing that an idle glance
might easily have passed it by unnoticed. A shadowy,
grey bar, bearing aloft what looked like a nut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim uttered a shout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove, it’s a submarine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as he shouted, a long grey shadow came into
view under the bar. Simultaneously, the engine-telegraph
clanged from the bridge, and following the
signal, the steamer altered her course with a jerk that
sent most of the standing passengers headlong to the
deck. They picked themselves up, unconscious of
bruises, rushing again to the rail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The submarine was well in view—a slender, vicious,
grey boat, with a little cluster of men visible on her
tiny deck, round the shaft of the periscope. She was
terribly near. Suddenly a volume of black smoke
gushed from the steamer’s funnels; the firemen were
flinging themselves at their work below, since on speed
alone hung their slender hope of safety. Again she
altered her course. Sharp orders came from the
bridge; sailors were running to and fro, and an
officer was serving out life-belts frantically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something shot from the submarine—something
that made a long, glistening streak across the water,
coming straight towards them like a flash; and David
Linton flung his arm round Norah muttering, “My
God!” A strained, high voice cried, “A torpedo!”
and then silence fell upon the ship, broken only by
the smothered gasps of women. Straight and swift
the streak came; unimaginably swift, and yet the
watching seemed a lifetime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold tight to the rail,” Jim’s voice said in Norah’s
ear. She gripped mechanically; and as she did so,
the steamer jerked again, plunging to one side like a
frightened horse that sees danger. It was just in
time. The torpedo shot past, missing the bow by a
fraction—a space so small that it was almost impossible
to believe that it had indeed missed. Then came
relief, finding vent in an irrepressible shout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s too soon to shout,” some one said. “She’ll
make better shooting next time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stewards and sailors were hurrying round, distributing
life-belts; it was no easy matter to put them on,
for the ship was zigzagging wildly, dodging in a
desperate effort to elude her pursuer, and balance was
impossible without a firm hold on some fixed object.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit on the deck—it’s safest,” said Mr. Linton. He
fastened Norah’s life-belt, while Jim performed a
similar office for him, and Wally put one on the old
priest, who was so wild with excitement as to be quite
oblivious of any such precaution. His face was
deadly white, his dark eyes blazing. In his first fall
he had lost his black felt hat, and his silver hair waved
in the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The murdering villains—the assassins!” he said.
“Yerra, if I could fight!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An officer called for helpers to bring the women and
children from below. Jim and Wally sprang in
answer, and a crowd of soldiers came tumbling up from
for’ard, elbowing their officers in mad excitement and
the rush to be first. Quick and strong hands were
needed on the companion ladders with their burdens,
as the ship plunged hither and thither, racing in zig-zags
at top speed. Many of the women were helpless
between fear and the aftermath of sea-sickness; but
they came without outcry, with set white faces,
determined, if this were indeed Death, to die decently.
The babies howled with a lusty disregard of the world
common to babies, while the soldiers patted them
with far more concern than they showed for the submarine.
In a very few minutes not a soul was left
below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do we zigzag?” Norah asked, clinging to
the rail as a fresh jerk shook the ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s our only chance,” Jim answered. “I don’t
think the submarines can beat these boats for speed,
or else she’d just come up and sink us at her leisure;
and she can’t take aim accurately if we’re dodging.
Of course we cut down our speed by not going straight;
but we can’t afford the risk of letting her train her
torpedo-tube carefully on us. Jove, can’t the skipper
handle this ship! She answers the helm like a motor-car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And can’t she go!” uttered Wally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the mail-boats are built for speed and not much
else—thank goodness!” Jim said. “Look!—she’s
firing again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the streak shot from the pursuing submarine
and darted towards them. They held their breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a very close shave—only a lightning swerve
saved the mail-boat. The old priest uttered a sudden
shout of triumph. “Whirroo!” he cried—for a
moment just the boy who had left Wicklow more than
forty years ago. He shook as he gripped the rail,
laughing at the racing grey shadow that followed them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim Linton’s eyes were on his little sister: and
Norah, feeling them, slipped a hand into his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it hadn’t been for us you wouldn’t be in this,”
he said, miserably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah opened her eyes in amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that just makes it not matter so much,” she
said. “Just fancy if we weren’t all together! Don’t
you worry, Jimmy.” She smiled at him very cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she hits us and we begin to sink, don’t wait for
the ship to go over,” Mr. Linton said. “Half the
boats on the <span class='it'>Lusitania</span> were death-traps. Let us all
jump in and keep together if we can; we would have
more chance of being picked up, and less of being
taken down in the suction as she sank. Can you
swim, Father?”—to the priest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can. But it’s years since I tried, and I don’t
know would I keep afloat at all,” said the old man,
with unimpaired cheerfulness. “Let you take your
own course, and not trouble about me. I’m too old
to try jumping, and there’ll be some poor souls I could
maybe help. And we’re not beaten yet.” He gave a
quick laugh, his grey head well up. “We’re running
away, but it’s a good fight we’re putting up, all the
same: something to see, after forty years in a New
York slum!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe he likes it!” said Wally, under his breath.
But the old man caught the words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like it! I used to dream of adventures when I
was a boy, and it was all the sea—clean winds and
waves, and ships that were always magic to me. And
it ended in a slum: forty years of it, doing my work in
the midst of filth and wretchedness. Well, every man
has his work, and mine lay there. And now, at the
end, this! I always knew ’twas luck I’d have if I got
back to Ireland!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had raced away in a straight course after the
second torpedo, increasing the distance from their
pursuer. Now, however, a shot hummed past them,
and the captain dared no longer risk a hit—again the
ship swerved from side to side, in short, irregular tacks,
and the submarine drew nearer once more. On and
on—leaping like a hare when the greyhound is behind
her: engines throbbing, smoke blackening the sky in
her wake. Some of the firemen had staggered up,
exhausted, their places taken by volunteers. Ahead,
a dim line lay upon the sea: the Irish coast, where lay
safety. Would they ever reach it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, from the north, came rescue: a patrol-boat,
racing down upon them with threatening guns ready
to speak in their defence. She came out of a light
haze, which, blowing away, revealed her dogged grey
shape, with the white water churning and parting at
her bow. Presently one of her guns spoke, and a
shell buried itself in the sea not far from the submarine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So long, Brother Boche!” said an officer; and
suddenly, as if in answer, the submarine disappeared,
submerging to the safety of the underworld. The
mail-boat ceased to zigzag, running a straight course
until near the destroyer, as a child runs to a protector.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tension relaxed. Voices broke out in quick
clamour: and then cheer after cheer came from the
pent-up passengers, redoubling as the captain’s face
showed over the railings of the bridge. The captain
grinned, saluted, and looked at his watch all at once:
the danger was over, and now the pressing business of
his ordinary life reasserted itself—the landing in time
at Kingstown Pier of His Majesty’s mails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>People were laughing and talking nervously, keeping
an anxious look-out towards the spot where the submarine
had disappeared; scarcely realizing that their
peril was past, and that the grey hunter would not
again reveal itself, hurrying upon their track. The
destroyer shot past them, seeking the enemy, with
signal flags talking busily to the mail-boat. A comforting
sense of security was in her wake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well!” said Jim. “We left England to find
peace and quiet; but if this is a specimen of what
Ireland means to give us——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d better get back to the peaceful marshes of
Flanders,” finished Wally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I used to think when I was at home—at Billabong—that
excitement would be nice,” said Norah. “But
it isn’t—not a bit: or else I’ve had an overdose. At
any rate, I don’t want any more as long as I live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little sigh came from behind her, and her father
made a sudden movement, springing to the side of the
priest. The old man was swaying backwards and forwards.
They caught him, and laid him gently on the
deck. His lips parted, and he tried to speak, but no
sound came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go and look for a doctor,” said Mr. Linton to
Wally. “Quick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tore at the old man’s collar, while Norah rubbed
his hands desperately. It seemed the only thing she
could do. A little life came into the white face, and
his voice came faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis the finish for me—don’t worry .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my
heart.” He smiled at them. “And the doctor after
telling me not to get excited.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t talk,” Norah begged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It can’t hurt me. Don’t mind, little one.” He
saw the tears in her eyes, and tightened his hand on her
fingers. “ ’Tis a good ending. I wouldn’t ask for a
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally came back, a young man in uniform, with the
R.A.M.C. badge on his collar, at his heels. The doctor
bent over the old priest. Presently he rose, shaking
his head as he met David Linton’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing to be done,” he said, softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man’s hearing was no less acute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis myself could have told you that,” he said.
“I knew .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. next time it came. And .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when
a man’s ready .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice became almost inaudible, murmuring
broken words of prayer. Behind them Jim had
formed a line of soldiers, keeping off the curious
crowd. Presently he spoke again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s easy, dying. Only it would be easier if I’d
seen it again .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ireland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re very near,” Norah told him, pityingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Near! And not to see it!” He tried to
rise, helplessly. “Ah, but let me look—let me
look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>David Linton’s eyes met the doctor’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It can’t hurt him,” whispered the doctor. “Nothing
can do that now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They lifted him, very gently. Ahead, the hills of
Wicklow were green and near. The grey sky had
broken, and a little shaft of sunlight stole out and lay
upon the coast. It was as though Ireland smiled to
welcome back her son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dark eyes looked long and wistfully. Once he
smiled at Norah; and then looked back quickly, as
though to lose no instant of home. Presently his lips
parted in broken words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Till we see .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. till we see Ireland again; and
life or death will be the same to us after that.” Then
no more words came. But when the doctor signed
to them to lay him down he was still smiling.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>‟W</span>E ought to be nearly there,” said Jim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ought’ seems to be the last argument
that counts on this railway line,” his father answered.
“What grounds have you for your fond belief?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not time-tables,” his son admitted. “They
wore out long ago; I scrapped them when they got to
the stage when reading them only led to despair.
Partly I’m hoping that the guard wasn’t merely trying
to keep up my spirits when he told me we’d get to
Killard at three o’clock if Jamesy Doyle wasn’t late
with his milk-cans at Ballymoe; only he added that
’twas the bad little ass Jamesy had, and if it lay down
in the cart how would the poor man be in time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And will they wait for Jamesy and his cans?”
queried Wally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most certainly, I should think. Passengers are
just odd happenings, to the guard; but Jamesy is
married to a woman that’s the cousin of his wife’s
aunt, and the guard evidently has a strong family
sense. This train exists as much to carry Jamesy’s
cans as anything else. However, there’s Ballymoe,
and the gentleman on the platform looks as if he might
be Jamesy. And there’s the ass in the cart outside,
standing up. I expect it’s all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little train drew slowly into the wayside station,
and the guard, descending, wrung the hand of the
somnolent gentleman enthroned upon the milk-cans.
Together they proceeded to load them into the van,
but being overcome by argument in the middle of the
operation, relinquished work, sat down on the cans,
and gave themselves up to the delights of conversation.
The Linton family got out, and walked along the
platform. They had been travelling from early morning
into the wilds of Donegal, and, since leaving the
main line for a succession of local trains, had grown
well accustomed to these sociable delays. Presently
the engine-driver and his fireman left their engine and
joined the discussion on the milk-cans. Norah strolled
to the road and scratched the ass gently, a proceeding
accepted by the ass without resentment, but without
enthusiasm. Time went by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gathering on the platform dissolved itself after
a while, the first move being made by Mr. Jamesy
Doyle, who remarked that his wife’d be tearing the
hair off of him, and she waiting for him for dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll not wait long on ye; I know that one!”
said the guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She will, then; sure, haven’t I it bought in the
little cart yonder?” said Jamesy, with the calmness
of certainty. He assisted to place the remainder of
his property in the van, and the guard, addressing
Norah with enormous politeness, mentioned that
when she was quite ready the train would go on.
“Let you not be hurrying yourself—sure we’re that
late already as makes no difference,” he added, pleasantly.
They climbed in, and the little train clanged
and rattled on its way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the next station two energetic men in tweed suits
descended hurriedly from the one first-class smoking-carriage
and demanded their bicycles, which had been
put in an empty truck—the train being of the type
known as a “mixed goods.” Thereafter arose sounds
of wrath and vituperation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something’s up; I’m going to see,” said Wally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all went to see. The two cyclists, visions of
helpless rage, confronted a scene of desolation. The
truck, being opened, disclosed upon the floor a mingled
heap of scrap-iron and twisted metal, which had once
been two fair bicycles: in the midst of which, firmly
caught among the battered spokes, a couple of fat
wethers stood and bleated a woe almost equal to that
of the cyclists. A dozen more sheep, most of them
bearing traces of conflict with the defunct machines,
in the shape of scarred legs, pressed about the doorway,
while the guard, distraught to incoherence, endeavoured
to restrain them from escaping while attempting to
justify himself before the outraged owners. Totally
unsuccessful in the second endeavour, he was only
partially fortunate in the first: a black-faced sheep,
bearing a mudguard wedged upon his horns, made a
dash for freedom and fled wildly down the platform,
apparently maddened by his unfamiliar adornment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I after putting them in at one end of the
truck!” lamented the guard—“and them bikes
standing against the other end! Wasn’t there room
for them all—how would I know they’d mix up on
me! Get back there, bad luck to ye, ye vilyun!”—to
another black-faced aspirant for liberty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helpers, divided in their sympathies, but with the
preponderance of feeling on the side of the guard,
appeared mysteriously from an apparently empty
landscape and disentangled the sheep from the ruins.
The engine-driver, cutting the Gordian knot of debate,
discovered that the time-table demanded that the
train should proceed forthwith; and the cyclists were
left foaming over a twisted heap on the platform,
threatening immediate telegrams to headquarters,
and, if necessary, murder. As the train slid away
from the sound of their lamentations, the fugitive sheep
could be descried standing on a bank, his black visage
melancholy beneath the mudguard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the next station, the guard, with a chastened face,
appeared at the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Killard, sir,” he stated. “And Patsy Burke, he
have the outside car and an ass-cart for ye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Linton and his party obeyed the summons
gladly. They found themselves on a grass-grown
platform, boasting very rudimentary station-buildings.
Beyond, a road ran east and west, bordered by high
banks, while on either side were small fields and wide,
flat stretches of bog. A long, thin man advanced to
meet them. No one else had left the train, and he
accepted them, without introduction, as his responsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The car is below in the road,” he said. “The
little horse, he have an objection to the train; he’d
lep a ditch sooner than face it. I’ll throw the luggage
on the ass-cart, sir, before I take you up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guard, still subdued in spirit, was diligently
hauling out boxes from his van. A suit-case and the
rod-box, failing to appear, were made the objects of
fevered search, despaired of, promised by the next
train, and finally discovered in an empty third class
carriage, all within the space of five minutes. The
ass-cart, drawn by a dispirited donkey without energy
to disapprove of trains, was backed on to the platform,
and the luggage piled upon it in a tottery heap, secured—more
or less—by an assortment of knotted string and
old rope. Then the guard and engine-driver, both of
whom had assisted enthusiastically, bade an affectionate
farewell, and the train disappeared slowly,
while the Australians followed Patsy Burke meekly to
the outside car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dublin had already introduced them to the jaunting-car
of Ireland, and they had fallen instant victims to
the fascination of that most irresponsible vehicle.
English tourists are wont to regard it with fear and
trembling until familiar with its ways: to hold on
desperately, to sit stiffly, and, very frequently, to fall
off when rounding corners. That the Linton party
did none of these things was not due to any superior
intelligence on their parts, but merely to the fact that
the back-to-back position on the open-air cars of the
Melbourne tramways proved an excellent introduction
to the Irish vehicle—insomuch that the force of habit
was so strong in Wally that the Melbourne gripman’s
habitual ejaculation, “Hold <span class='it'>tight</span> round the curve!”
sprang unbidden to his lips every time the jarveys took
a corner on one wheel. The Dublin jarveys had liked
the cheery Australians, who paid well and frankly
averred that there was never any conveyance like the
jingling cars with their merry little bells, and their
good horses; and the jarveys of Dublin are a critical
race, with quick tongues and quicker wits. They had
confided to them their woes, which centred round
the introduction of motor-cars and the complete
indifference of pedestrians to the rule of the road—an
indifference universal throughout Ireland, where the
unseasoned traveller is perpetually a-shiver with dread
at threatened street tragedies, perpetually averted by
good luck that amounts to a miracle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never seen the equal of these people,” one of their
drivers had said, emitting a roar like a bull of Bashan,
which barely saved an elderly woman from what
looked like deliberate suicide under his horse’s hoofs.
“Yerra, ma’am, is it owning the road you are?”—to
the lady, who pursued her leisurely way with the
calmness born of many such episodes. “Young or
old, ’tis all the same; they do be strolling the streets
for all the world as if they was picking mushrooms,
and taking no notice of you till you’d be knocking them
down—and then they do be annoyed! There’s only
one way, and that is to let a roar out of you at them—and
then the look they give you is worse than a curse!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you get into trouble if you kill more than
six a day,” Wally had said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The jarvey grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trouble, is it? Sure, some of them makes a trade
of it; there’s them old wasters in this town that’d ask
nothing better than that you’d knock ’em down—not
to kill them, but to knock a small piece off them, the
way you’d have to support them afterwards. There’s
one man I but tipped with the end of a shaft, and he
strolling at his aise in a crowd. Crawling at a slow
walk I was; and what did he do but rowl on the
ground before me, letting on that he was kilt. There
was none of the polis about, so I left him rowling and
calling murder!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you hear any more of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did. Didn’t he come to me that evening and
say he had his witnesses ready, and he’d be making a
polis-court matter of it if I didn’t give him five pounds?
‘I do be making twenty-eight shillings a week,’ says
he, ‘in me health,’ says he, and now ’tis the way I
cannot lift me hand to me head,’ he says. Him, that
never earned five shillings in a week in his life, and not
that, if he could steal it! I towld him to bring his
polis-court and his dirty witnesses, and that if he did,
I’d pay the five pounds for the pleasure I’d have in
belting the life out of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And did he bring it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did not. I seen him a week after that, and he
cleaning steps. ‘I’m glad to see you looking so well
and hearty, me poor man!’ says I to him; and he
thrun a look at me fit to kill. Sure I knew that one’d
be more anxious to keep out of the way of the polis
than to be dandhering about them with his cases!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dublin cars had been smart affairs, spick-and-span
with bright paint and clean upholstering, every
buckle on their harness polished brightly. Their
rubber tyres strove to soften the asperities of cobbled
streets. But the car to which Patsy Burke led the
Australians was of a different aspect: small and forbidding,
with straight up-and-down seats whereon
reposed cushions from which the stuffing had chiefly
escaped, the insignificant remnant remaining in hard
knobs in the corners. The original wood peeped out
through faint streaks of the original paint, while here
and there patches of deal and hoop-iron lent variety
to the exterior. Many different sets had contributed
towards the composition of the harness, wherein nothing
matched except in age and decrepitude. A
tattered urchin stood at the head of the little horse
which had an objection to trains. The horse was
asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I were asked,” murmured Norah, surveying
him, “I would say he had an objection to moving at
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He looks as if he would like to lean up against a
tree and dream,” said Wally, “and good gracious! is
he going to drag the lot of us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why wouldn’t he?” asked Mr. Burke, with some
asperity. “Git along with ye to the ass, John Conolly,”—to
the boy—“and lend a hand to the big thrunk
when the road does be rough, or it will fall off on ye.
Will ye get up, miss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it far?” asked Norah, regarding the somnolent
horse with troubled eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis five Irish miles, miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But can he take us all? There’s—there’s so much
of us,” said Norah, her glance roving over her tall
menfolk, and dwelling finally on Mr. Burke, who was
not less tall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Him!” said Mr. Burke. “But isn’t the luggage
on the ass-cart? Sure it’ll only be a luxury for him—many’s
the time I’ve known that one with seven or
eight behind him, going to a funeral, and he that full
of courage, I’d me own throubles to keep him from
bolting? Let ye get up, and ’tis little he’ll be making
of ye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They got up, unhappily, and Mr. Burke hopped
into the driver’s seat—which is occupied only in time
of stress, the jarvey greatly preferring to drive from
the side. He said, “G’wan, now!” to the little horse,
and that animal awoke and took the road gallantly,
while a cracked bell on his collar rattled a discordant
accompaniment to his hoof-beats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They jogged on between the high banks. The scent
of the whitethorn that made snow upon their crests
flooded the air, and mingled with deep wafts of odour
from clumps of furze lying golden in the fields. There
were other flowers starring the hedges; honeysuckle,
waving long arms of sweetness, and, nestling closely
in the grass-grown banks, clusters of wild violets,
starry celandines and even a few late primroses. There
were many houses in sight; little whitewashed cabins
scattered over the hills, approached by narrow boreens
or tiny lanes, so narrow that it seemed that even an
ass-cart could scarcely manage to squeeze in between
their towering banks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever see such little paddocks—fields, I
ought to say?” uttered Wally. “And the great fat
banks and hedges between them! Why, they must
cover as much ground as there is in many of the
fields!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d put wire-fences, in Australia,” said Mr.
Linton, laughing. “It’s queer, when you come to
think of it: we’re supposed to have land to spare, but
we put the narrowest fences that can be made; and
here, there isn’t enough to go round, and they cover
up ever so much of it with their banks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but aren’t you glad they don’t make wire-fences!”
Norah broke out. “They’re so hideous:
and these hedges are just exquisite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not being a landholder, I am, indeed,” said her
father. “The idea of this landscape given up to
wire-fences is depressing—long may they stick to their
banks! And their shelter must be valuable in this
country; they don’t seem to have many trees.” His
eye ran over the bare little fields. “Don’t you grow
trees, in Donegal?” he asked of the back of Mr.
Burke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That gentleman, feeling himself addressed, swung
round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There do be plenty in the woods and in gentlemen’s
grounds, sir. I never seen any in the fields. They
do say there was any amount in the ould ancient days,
or how would the bogs be there? Forests, no less;
and quare beasts in them. I’ve seen ould heads of
deer with horns that wide you’d never get them up a
boreen. There were no fields and no fences in those
days, and people lived by hunting—great hunting
those big deer would give them, to be sure. If you’d
kill a rabbit nowadays it’d be as much as you’d do
to ate it before the polis had you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If killing rabbits is what you care for, you might
come to Australia,” said Jim, laughing. “You would
certainly be welcome there. Only after a little while,
you wouldn’t eat any.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a lad I knew in Derry went out to them
parts,” said Mr. Burke, “and he sent home letters
with such tales of his doings you wouldn’t believe
them. He said there were beasts that hopped on
their tails faster than a horse ’ud gallop, and rabbits
that had the face ate off the country. Like a carpet
on the floor, he says. But sure he was always the
boy that’d spin you a yarn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a true yarn, anyhow,” Jim remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do ye tell me, now?” The long face of Patsy
Burke was respectful, but incredulous, “And another
thing he said, that a man couldn’t believe: that the
genthry’d go out and poison foxes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They would,” said Mr. Linton. “Gladly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But——” Words failed Mr. Burke. He gaped
at his passengers. The horse dropped to a walk,
unheeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poison them, or shoot them, or get rid of them
in any way possible,” said Jim, enjoying the mounting
agony of Mr. Burke. “We can’t do much hunting,
you see, when we live on big places, with the nearest
neighbour perhaps twenty miles off; and often the
hills are so steep and rough, and so thick with fallen
timber, that horses and hounds would want wings to
hunt through them. But a man may have thousands
of sheep on hills like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do ye tell me? Thousands, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather. And the foxes breed like rabbits in those
hills, and there’s nothing they like so well as young
lambs. You can go out in the morning and find forty
or fifty dead lambs—the cruel brutes of foxes just eat
their noses and go on to the next. When you see
that number of little lambs killed, in that fashion,
you’re ready to start poisoning foxes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye would so,” said Mr. Burke, explosively. “And
no one interferes with ye?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you get paid for it,” Jim said. To which
Mr. Burke replied by a gasp of “God help us!” and
relieved his feelings by lashing the horse with a shout
of “G’wan, now!” The horse broke into a surprised
canter, and they rocked down a little hill. At its
foot a wide expanse of bog stretched westward, looking
like a great grassy plain. Here and there, near the
road, men were working at cutting turf, armed with
the loy or narrow, sharp spade, which takes out a sod
of turf, the size of a brick, to be stacked to dry in the
sun. A great corner had already been cut away, and
lay bleak and desolate. Above its level the wall of
turf rose three or four feet, a dark-brown glutinous-looking
mass, smoothly marked with the scars of the
loy. There were deep pools of water here and there:
the brown bog-water that scares the English tourists
who finds it in a bedroom jug in a hotel, and gives
foundation for future scathing comments on the dirty
ways of Ireland: the fact being that if its exquisite
velvet-softness could be taken to London, most of the
Bond Street complexion specialists would go out of
business for lack of customers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that’s turf,” commented Wally, looking curiously
at the rough stacks of sods, which the sun was
drying to a lighter colour than the deep brown of the
bog-face. “It doesn’t look the sort of stuff you’d
make fires of—wherein I expect I show my hideous
ignorance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Burke had begun with a snort at the first part
of this remark, but checked it in its birth at the frank
avowal of the conclusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait till ye see it burn, sir,” he said. “Ye’d not
want a better fire, barring ye could get a bit of bog-wood
to mix with it. Then ye’d not get its aiqual
if ye were walking the world all your life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are those pools deep?” Norah asked, looking
at the still brown water, fringed with reeds and sedges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of ’em’s no depth at all; and there’s some
that deep that no man knows the bottom of ’em.
They’d take anyone and swallow him entirely, the
way he’d never be heard of again; and they do say
the bog keeps ’em fresh as if they’d just fallen in, only
I dunno would it be true: I never seen anybody that
had come out. It’s one of the old stories that do be
going in the country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When <span class='it'>we</span> talk about a bog, we mean something
that looks—well, boggy,” Norah said. “I never
thought an Irish bog looked so pretty; all grass and
rushes, like a big plain. Why do they call it a bog?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d know if you got into it,” said Mr. Burke,
bearing patiently with the ignorance of the foreigner.
“There’s parts of it firm enough to gallop a horse
over; but you’d want to know where you were going,
it’s that treacherous—it’d let you down as deep as
your waist in a second, and it looking safe as a street.
Some of the mosses that do be growing on it ’ud warn
you: there’s one or two kinds that only grow where
it’s deep and quaking. As for pretty—it’s airly yet
for flowers; but you’d see it like a garden, in the
autumn, with meadowsweet and loosestrife and
canavan, that they call the bog-cotton, like snow
lying on it. There’s no end to the quare things that
do be growing in a bog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They passed ass-carts, built up with basket work to
form creels, piled high with turf,—generally in the
charge of a barefooted urchin, dark-eyed and graceful
in his rags, who would fling a cheery “Good-day” at
the car rattling by, touching his cap to “the genthry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis a great year for saving turf,” Mr. Burke told
them. “There’s no knowing what the war’ll be doing
with prices; they say the poor people’ll be hard put to
it to go on living at all. So everyone’s getting turf;
sure, it’s easier to be hungry if you’re warm. I
dunno, at all, why would they make a war: didn’t
we have enough and too much to pay for tea and
tobacco as it was without the ould Kaiser poking in
his nose?” Thus adjusting satisfactorily the responsibility
for his financial troubles, Mr. Burke
addressed the horse angrily, and drove on in
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came to a little river, brawling merrily under a
bridge of grey stone. A turn in the road brought trees
in view, fringing a lough that lay tranquil in the sunlight;
a placid sheet of blue water broken here and
there by tiny islands. Towards the end that was
nearest, the trees were thickly planted. Between
them they caught glimpses of an old stone house
nestling in a wilderness of a garden that ran down
almost to the edge of the lough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patsy Burke swung the little horse in through a
gateway, the iron gates of which stood invitingly
open. They jogged up a winding avenue, overhung
with lofty beech-trees. It ended suddenly in front
of the house. Through a wide doorway they could
see a dim hall, where a bewildering collection of old
guns and blunderbusses was ranged over a massive
mahogany table, the legs of which ended in claw-feet
that would have drawn a connoisseur like a magnet.
Honeysuckle and roses climbed together up the old
walls, framing the doorway in blossom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are ye there, ma’am?” bawled Patsy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pleasant-faced woman came through the hall
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d have given up expecting you, if that old train
was ever in time,” she said, giving a hand to Norah
as that damsel hopped from the car. “Aren’t you
all tired out, and you travelling since early morning?
Come in then—there’s hot water waiting in your
rooms, and tea will be ready in ten minutes. Is the
luggage coming, Patsy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is, ma’am,” responded Mr. Burke. “Lasteways,
if that image of a John Conolly doesn’t play
any of his thricks with the ass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps, now, you’d be better going back to meet
him when you have the horse stabled,” suggested his
mistress. “I wouldn’t have the luggage delayed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, sure, it will be all right,” said Mr. Burke,
hastily, “John Conolly’s not that bad; he’ll get it
here sometime, but where’d be the use of hurrying the
ass? Well, I’ll throw a look down the road when I’m
after putting the car by, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that makes sure of me poor Brownie getting
a good grooming,” murmured the landlady, ushering
her guests into the house as the car jogged stablewards.
“Patsy’s not that fond of a walk that he’d scamp his
job to be travelling the road after John Conolly. Are
you there, Bridget?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am, ma’am,” said a pretty girl, appearing from
the back of the hall with such swiftness as to compel
the belief that she had been surreptitiously observing
the new-comers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take the gentlemen to their rooms,” commanded
the landlady. “Will you come with me, Miss Linton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah followed her up the broad staircase. A wide
corridor led through mouldering archways, whence
passages branched off to right and left. The walls bore
signs of decorations of a bygone day, now faint and
faded with age. The landlady threw open the door
of a large room, with two windows looking over the
lough. A huge bed occupied an alcove: bare acreages
of floor intervened between isolated pieces of furniture,
with rugs lying, like islands, on the stained boards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I took up the carpet—’twas old and there were
holes in it you’d fall through,” said the landlady.
“But I could put you in a smaller room if you’d rather
have a carpet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like this,” Norah said, looking round the clean
bareness of the room. “But can’t I have the windows
open?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have to fight Bridget over them,” replied
the landlady, flinging both windows wide. “I opened
them twice this morning, but she shut them again;
and the second time she was so anxious about all the
deaths you’d be dying with the dint of the cold blast
sweeping in, that I let them stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t think there was any cold blast,” Norah
said laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There wasn’t; but Bridget thinks that any air
that comes in through an open window is a blast, even
if it’s the middle of summer. Have you everything
you want, Miss Linton? I’m sure you’ll all be
famished for your tea, and I’ll run and see to
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think this is a jolly place,” Norah said, as they
gathered, ten minutes later, round a table that might
certainly have groaned under its load of good things,
had it not been made of exceedingly solid old mahogany.
“It’s not a bit like a boarding-house, is it? There’s
such a home-y feel about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a home-y look about this table,” Jim
averred. “I haven’t seen anything like it since we
left Billabong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were crusty loaves of Irish soda-bread, which
is better than anything else except the home-made
bread of Australia, heaps of brown, crisp scones,
buttered hot-cakes, and glass dishes with ruby-coloured
jams. A bowl of cream was in the middle,
and a dish of rich dark honey in the comb—not like
the anæmic honey one buys in London, which is made
by fat and lazy bees out of dishes of sugar and water,
and tastes like it. The Irish bees had worked over
miles of heathery moorland, and their honey held
something of the heather’s fresh sweetness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think of the trenches—and bully beef!” ejaculated
Wally. “I say, what’s this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had uncovered a smoking plateful of a queer
flat substance, on which attention was immediately
focussed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does one eat it?” Norah queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blessed if I know,” Jim answered. “It looks a
bit queer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Light suddenly illumined Mr. Linton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless us, that’s potato-cake!” he exclaimed.
“I haven’t tasted it for many a year, and it’s one of
the best things going. It ought to be eaten so hot
that it burns the mouth, so I advise you not to lose
time.’ He helped himself, declaring that no considerations
of etiquette were to stand in the way of
the proper temperature of a potato-cake, and the
others somewhat doubtfully followed his example. In
a very short time the plate was empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>That’s</span> a recipe I’ll take back to Brownie!” was
Norah’s significant comment. “Do you think Mrs.
Moroney would let me have a lesson on it in the
kitchen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Moroney seems inclined to eat from one’s
hand,” said Mr. Linton. “She’s desperately anxious
for us to be comfortable. You know, we were told in
London that she had only begun this business since
the war—her husband is at the front—so time hasn’t
soured her as it sours most landladies. We’re lucky
in catching her in the fluid state: later on she’ll
solidify into the adamantine condition that is truly
landladylike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meanwhile, she’s rather an old duck,” said Wally.
“Hallo, who’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A small rosy face, crowned with a tangle of yellow
curls, was peeping round the doorway. Finding itself
observed, it hastily disappeared. Norah snatched a
sponge-cake and went in swift pursuit, returning, a
moment later, with a very small boy clad in a blue
shirt and ridiculously diminutive knickerbockers,
who greeted the company with a friendly smile somewhat
complicated by a large mouthful of cake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re a cheerful person,” Jim said. “What’s
your name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Timsy,” said the new-comer. “And I’m eight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I call that genius,” said Wally. “He knew you’d
ask him that next, so he saved you the trouble. Do
you live here, Timsy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small boy nodded vigorously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me daddy’s gorn,” he volunteered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fightin’ the Gair-mins. They’s bad—they’s after
hurtin’ him in the laig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did they?” said Wally, sympathetically. “Poor
daddy! Is he better?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is. He’s goin’ to shoot me some.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he, now? Will he bring them home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno will he. I asked the postman, an’ he
said daddy couldn’t post ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That wasn’t nice of the postman,” said Jim.
“What would you do with them if you got them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Frow fings at ’em,” said Timsy, valiantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good man!” said Jim. “We’ll have you in the
trenches before the war’s over, I expect. Another
cake, old chap?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timsy accepted the cake graciously, digging his
white teeth into it with appreciation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m after having me tea,” he confided. “An’
Bridget said there wasn’t any cake. But there’s lots.”
His eye swept the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is, indeed,” said Jim, guiltily. “Just you
have as much as you feel like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you a soldier?” demanded Timsy, his eyes
on Jim’s uniform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like me daddy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not as good, I expect,” said Jim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me daddy’s the finest soldier ever went out of
Ireland—old Nanny told me he was. And she said
if once he met that old Kaiser he’d be sorry he ever
got borned. An’ he would, too, if me daddy cot him.
An he’s a sergeant, ’cause he’s got free stripes on his
arm. Why hasn’t you got any?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know as much as your daddy,” said Jim,
probably with perfect truth. “When I get bigger
they may give me some.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re bigger than me daddy, now,” said Timsy,
surveying him. “Only you haven’t got any whiskers.
I ’spect you have to have whiskers before you get free
stripes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect so,” Jim agreed. “I’ll grow some the
first minute I get time. What have you done with
your legs, Timsy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scratched ’em, I ’spect,” said Timsy, indifferently,
casting a fleeting glance at his bare brown legs, which
bore many marks of warfare. “They’s bwambles in
the wood. Why is your buttons dif-runt to me
daddy’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are your daddy’s like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timsy fished laboriously in the pocket of his shirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got one here,” he said. “It came uncottoned,
an’ fell off, an’ daddy said I could have it. Look—it’s
nicer than yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it is—isn’t your daddy a sergeant?”
said Jim, gravely. Timsy looked up sharply, and was
seized with compunction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you mind,” he said, hastily putting away
his cherished button, lest dangling it before the eyes
of his new friend should excite vain longings in his
soul. He slipped a grimy little paw into Jim’s.
“ ’Twill not be long at all before they make a sergeant
of you. Can you hurry up an’ grow whiskers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do my best,” returned Jim, laughing. “You’re
a good old sportsman, Timsy. Have another
cake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timsy’s head was bent over the dish in the tremendous
effort of selection, when a slight commotion was
heard in the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was without in the scullery,” said a high-pitched
voice, “and I after giving him his tea. ‘Let you
sit quiet there till I have a minute to put a decent
appearance on you,’ says I. ‘ ’Tis not in them ould
rags you’d be having the genthry see you,’ I says.
With that I wint back, an’ the kitchen was as bare as
the palm of me hand. I’ve called him till me throat’s
cracking——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that you, Timsy?” whispered Norah. The
dancing eyes of the culprit were sufficient answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blessed Hour!” said the voice of Mrs. Moroney,
torn between relief and wrath. Her good-natured
face hung in the doorway, presently followed by her
ample form. “Is it you, then, Timsy Moroney,
disgracing me and annoying the gentleman! Why
would you have him on your knee, sir, and he the
ragamuffin of the world? I’d not have you troubled
with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not troubling me at all, Mrs. Moroney,” Jim
assured her. “He’s an awfully friendly little chap.
Does it matter if he has cakes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question savoured of shutting the stable-door
after the stealing of the steed. Timsy ate his cake
hurriedly, lest disaster await him in the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing he doesn’t eat,” said his mother
resignedly. “But I’d not let him annoy you, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was no cake in the kitchen!” said Timsy,
fixing reproachful eyes on his parent. “How would
I have me tea, an’ no cake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cock you up with cake!” returned Mrs. Moroney,
spiritedly. “Well able to go without it you are, for
once in a while.” She relented before her son’s
appealing gaze. “Come away, then, and let Bridget
wash you: sure, she’s screaming all over the place
after you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timsy hesitated, regarding Jim with affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I come back some time?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you can,” said Jim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small boy climbed down slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m destroyed with washin’,” he complained.
“ ’Tis only at dinner-time she had me all soaped.
An’ I <span class='it'>hate</span> shoes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” The voice of his lamentations
died away as his mother swept him from the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nice kid,” said Jim, getting up. “Let’s go out
and reconnoitre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shadows were lengthening across the strip of
tree-fringed grass leading to the gate. Near the
house, the garden was a wilderness of colour and
fragrance. Roses and sweet-peas, stocks and asters,
nasturtiums and clematis, in a bewildering tangle,
jostled each other in the untidy beds and on the old
stone walls. Here and there was a mouldering summer-house,
its entrance almost blocked with hanging
creepers, while in shady nooks in the winding walks
were seats with an appearance of old age that suggested
prudence in sitting down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently they came upon a path leading abruptly
down-hill to the lough. They followed it, passing out
of the garden into a little field where small black
Kerry cattle looked inquisitively at them, and through
a rickety gate on to the shore, where grey pebbles
made a rough beach. A disconsolate donkey, attached
to a windlass, walked round and round in a weary
circle, pumping water up to the house—a spectacle
which promptly set Norah to hunting for a thistle for
him, which the donkey received coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would take more than a thistle to sweeten that
job,” said Wally. “Come and look at the boat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Patsy Burke was rather feverishly busy with
the boat—it had apparently occurred to him that
since the new-comers would assuredly want her it
might be as well to make certain that she was sound.
She was not sound—to rectify which obvious condition
Mr. Burke laboured mightily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s seen better days,” remarked Mr. Linton,
looking at the ancient vessel with critical eyes. Already
she had been extensively patched: her paint was
merely a memory, and she bore “a general flavour of
mild decay.” The oars, which lay near, had also been
mended many times. They did not match: a fact
which the Australians were to discover later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, sure, she’s a good boat,” said Mr. Burke.
“ ’Tis only the thrifle of a leak she have in her. You
wouldn’t ask an aisier or a kinder boat to pull than
that one—begob, she’s the best boat to be found on
any lough hereabouts.” This assertion also was to
be verified by time. “In the ould times, when the
family was here, many’s the day I’ve seen her, full of
red cushions and fine ladies, and she tearing up the
lough like a racehorse!” The poetic nature of Mr.
Burke’s memories moved him to a sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was the family?” queried Mr. Linton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The O’Donnells, to be sure,” answered Mr. Burke,
his long face expressing faint surprise at ignorance so
vast. “They owned all this country, from the ould
ancient times—but there’s none of them left now.
Me gran’father, and his gran’father before him, was
tenants under them. I’m told they were kings, one
time. But there’s nothing left of any of the ould
stock now—all their houses is sold, or falling to pieces,
an’ they at the ends of the earth, seeking their fortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The house is very old, isn’t it?” Norah asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis ould, and ’tis falling to decay—it ’ud take a
power of money to put it right. Ah, the good days
is gone from Ireland—what with the land war and the
famine, all the money was swept from her.” Mr.
Burke stopped abruptly. He pulled his battered felt
hat over his eyes and hammered vigorously at the old
boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went up through the fragrant garden, now
heavy with evening shadows. Above them the gaunt
old house towered, bosomed in its trees, dim with the
night mist from the lough. Lights were beginning to
twinkle from the windows, and the faint acrid smell
of turf fires stole upon the still air. To Norah’s fancy
the silent garden was peopled with shadowy forms—tall
gallants and exquisite ladies of a bygone day, and
little children who ran, laughing, along paths that had
no tangle of neglected growth. It was theirs; the
dream visions made her feel an interloper as she
crossed the threshold into the lit hall.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span> WEEK went by with the mysterious swiftness
of holiday weeks, especially in Ireland. No
one quite knew what became of the long June days;
they dawned in light mists that lay on the surface of
Lough Aniller, reddened with the sunrise, only to
vanish as the sun mounted; they widened to warm
brightness, with clear blue skies flecked with the
tiniest cloudlets; and sank to long, delicious twilights,
with just enough chill in the air to make light coats
necessary. No one was inclined for strenuous exertion.
Jim and Wally, under orders to take life very
easily for the present, were content to lie about in the
fragrant grass, to go for short walks along the borders
of the lough, or to let Patsy Burke row them slowly
up its placid waters, where scarcely a ripple marked
the rising of a trout. To Norah and her father it was
sufficient happiness to watch their boys gradually
winning back strength. Each day that went by and
brought no recurrence of throat-trouble was something
achieved; and the long, golden days smoothed the
weary lines from the boyish faces, and brought something
of the old tan into their cheeks. There was no
doubt that as a sanatorium Donegal merited all that
had been claimed of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were the only guests in the old stone house.
Later on, Mrs. Moroney told them, people were coming
from Dublin and Belfast: but the war had temporarily
killed the tourist traffic from England, and
Irish fishing was having a much-needed rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But for the fowl I have, indeed, I’d be hard put
to it,” said Mrs. Moroney. She reared innumerable
ducks and chickens, and carried on a thriving trade,
sending them ready dressed to England—aided by a
parcels post system which, unlike that of Australia,
does not appear to regard the senders and receivers
of parcels as wealthy eccentrics, to be heavily charged,
but otherwise unworthy of consideration. At all
times Mrs. Moroney was to be found plucking and
dressing her wares—keeping, nevertheless, an eagle
eye upon her household, and always ready to take
interest in the doings of her guests. Good nature
beamed from her countenance, and chicken-fluff always
ornamented her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timsy had constituted himself Jim’s shadow, and
courier-in-chief to the party. He knew all the country
with a boy’s knowledge, had an acquaintance with
the ways of trout which seemed miraculous in one of
his years, and cherished a feud of long standing with
John Conolly, whose treatment of the little ass did not
come up to the standard instilled into Timsy by the
sergeant, now in France. All these matters he placed
at the absolute disposal of Jim. The rest of the party
he treated politely: they were well enough. But the
big boy in khaki was somehow different, and Timsy
gave him all his warm little heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a shock to him that Jim and Wally appeared
in rough tweeds on the morning after their arrival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s you uny-forms?” demanded Timsy,
hopping on one foot on the mossy path, rather like an
impertinent sparrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upstairs,” Jim said, solemnly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why for don’t you put ’em on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t want to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timsy surveyed him with a pained air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me daddy says uny-form had a right to be wore
all the time,” he said. “He didn’t have no uvver
clothes when <span class='it'>he</span> came home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim relented at the small, worried face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell you how it is, old man,” he said. “The old
Germans laid us out; and we’re going to get better
as quick as we can, to go and lick them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” said Timsy, digging his heel into the
earth, in bloodthirsty ecstasy. “That’s what me
daddy’s after doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course he is. Well, we’ll get better quicker if
we haven’t got to wear heavy uniforms all the time,
don’t you see? So we asked leave; and a big general
said we could put on other clothes. He was a very
big general, so it’s all right, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was he very big?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enormous,” said Jim, gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he was very ’normous, I ’spect it’s all right,”
Timsy said, relinquishing his point with reluctance.
“Only I likes you best in uny-forms.” His eye suddenly
lit with new hope. “Do you think you’d
wear ’em on Sunday, an’ you goin’ to church?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would,” Jim said. “There, it’s a bargain,
Timsy.” So Timsy accepted the tweed knickerbockers
as necessary evils, and peace reigned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the trout, they had remained in peace.
Patsy Burke had given the Australians a few lessons
in throwing a fly, a gentle art to which they did not
take very kindly, though they proved apt enough
pupils. But the trout were not rising, and they
found it dull. Their previous experience had been
either the primitive method of a stick, a string, and
a worm, in the creeks at home, or a deep-sea hand-line
with a substantial bait and a heavy sinker. They
liked these peaceful ways, and to them the incessant
business of casting seemed, in the Australian phrase,
“too much like hard work.” They endeavoured,
however, to keep this view from the scandalized Mr.
Burke, whose scorn at the mere mention of a hand-line
was almost painful to witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In defence of their apathy, it must be admitted
that the sport was poor. The weather had been
unfavourable, and the brown trout declined to rise;
but even in the best of years Lough Aniller, the big
lough by the house, was not a good fishing lake. A
few rises came to them, which they missed: and they
had the poor satisfaction of beholding Mr. Burke land
a specimen which weighed not quite a quarter of a
pound. It did not seem, to untutored eyes quite
worth the candle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis a poor lake, anyways,” Mr. Burke said. They
were paddling home in the setting sun, the water
full of bright reflections. “I dunno why the trout
wouldn’t be in it: it’s the biggest hereabouts, but
they don’t seem wishful for it at all. There’s Lough
Nacurra and Lough Anoor—they’re little enough, but
you’d get finer fishing in them in a day than in a week
of Lough Aniller.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t we go there?” spoke Wally, lazily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no reason in the world why you shouldn’t.
Sure, they’re no distance, and the fishing belongs to
the house; there’ll not be a rod on them, barring
your own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do they mean, Patsy?” Norah asked. Mr.
Burke was her instructor in the Irish language, and
she thirsted for translations of each unknown word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lough Anoor’s the lough of the gold, miss, and
Lough Nacurra’s the lough of the Champions. I
dunno why they have those names on them; there’s
a lot of ould stories goin’. Whatever reason anybody
was to give, no one could say it was wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Lough Aniller means the lough of the Eagle,
you said, Patsy, but there don’t seem any eagles
about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thrue for ye,” agreed Mr. Burke; “they do not.
But I wouldn’t wonder if there was any amount of
them here in the ould ancient times.” He scanned
the placid waters with disfavour. “There’s one thing
they couldn’t call it, and that’s Nabrack—the lough
of the Trout!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They certainly couldn’t—whoever ‘they’ may
be,” said Wally, laughing. “There are just about as
many trout in this lough as there are in the front
garden, I believe. Who’ll come to one of the others
to-morrow?—I’ll have to learn their names before I
say them in public. I vote for the one that belongs
to the Champions!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lough Nacurra—ye might do worse,” said Patsy.
“ ’Tis a good little lough, and there’s a small little
island in it, that ’ud be a good place for you to be taking
your dinners. The boat’s no great thing at all—but
she’s better than the one on Lough Anoor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” exclaimed Mr. Linton. “Is she worse
than this one?” The boat on Lough Aniller had not
struck the party as an up-to-date craft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is,” said Mr. Burke. “But there’s no distance
to be pulling her: sure, the lough’s not big enough
to go any ways far. If ’twas Lough Anoor, now,
there’d be no good in me comin’ with you, for five
couldn’t sit in her. Four’ll be all she’ll hold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she safe?” asked Mr. Linton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it safe? Sure, you wouldn’t sink that one,
not if you danced in her,” said Patsy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had drifted almost to the end of the lough.
Above them the high road crossed the stone bridge.
The whir of a motor hummed across it, and, looking
up, they saw a grey runabout car, driven by a man
of whose face little could be seen, since goggles hid
his eyes and his cap was pulled low. Patsy touched
his cap hastily as the car vanished in its own dust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis the young masther,” he said; and added, as
if in further explanation, “Sir John, I mean—Sir
John O’Neill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does he live here?” Norah asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He do, miss. But a lot of his time he’s somewhere
else—London or foreign parts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought every landowner about here had gone
to the war,” Mr. Linton said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Begob, Sir John ’ud give the two eyes out of his
head to be gone, too,” said Patsy, shortly. “But
they won’t take him. ’Tis—’tis weakly he is. He
have the spirit of ten men in him; them ould German’s
’ud find their hands full, and they to be tackling
him in a tight place. Well, well—some people don’t
get much luck.” He stopped short, and rowed
violently for some time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you get many salmon here?” Jim asked, idly.
It was evident that Mr. Burke did not wish to pursue
the subject of Sir John O’Neill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the river—but only a few,” replied the boatman.
“ ’Twouldn’t be worth your while getting a licence, sir.
Sure it’s them ’ud give you a different idea of fishing.
I got one in Lough Illion, in Kerry, one time when I
was staying in them parts. That was the fish! He
tuk me four and a half hours to kill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew—w!” said Jim, respectfully. “He must
have been a big fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he was not that big at all; but he tuk the
fly as if he meant it, and down he went to the bottom
like a shtone. An’ there he lay, and I going round
and round him in the boat, trying any ways to shift
him, and he sulking in the weeds. Banging my rod
I was, and pelting at him all the bits of rock I had in
the boat, and I couldn’t shtir him. I was famished
out, for it was pegging hailshtones and sleet. At
last he come up; and then he thought better of it, when
he saw the sky above him, and he was going down again,
and I let a dhrive at him with the gaff, and got him
just near the tail—great luck I had with him, to be sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was about time you did have some luck,” Jim
remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s not many of them ’ud sulk like that,” said
Patsy. “Generally they’d be tiring themselves with
the runs they’s take at the first. And if they thrun
a lep or two—’tis the lep takes most out of them: it
breaks their courage. There’s nothing like a salmon,
to my way of thinking, though there’s a lot of the
gentry do be sticking to the little brown trout. Will
ye be for Lough Nacurra in the morning, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will—if you’ll promise us fish,” Jim responded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ’ud be a bold man to promise anything this
weather,” said Patsy, looking with disfavour at the
clear sky and the placid lough. “Still-an’-all, ’tis a
good lough; if they’re rising anywhere it’ll be on
Nacurra.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morning came with a haze lying on the blue hills,
and a fitful breeze: the best fishing day yet, Patsy
pronounced it, as he shouldered a gigantic luncheon-basket
and led the way down the avenue and along
the dusty high road. They struck across the bog
presently, following a path that led through a tangle
of the sweet bog-myrtle; and, in a little harbour of
smooth grey stones at the western end of Lough
Nacurra, came upon their boat, half-concealed among
the rushes fringing the water’s edge. The lough was
a long narrow sheet of water, widening a little at the
far end, where a thickly-wooded island showed dimly
through the haze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you been storing water in the boat?” Jim
inquired, gravely, surveying the ancient craft among
the rushes. Its bottom timbers bore evidence of long
soaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tis a thrifle of dampness she have in her,” admitted
Mr. Burke, stepping in carefully and getting to
work with a baling-tin. “I’m after sending John
Conolly up only this morning to bale her out, but he’s
the champion at scamping a job. Ah, she’ll dry out
beautifully in the sun, sir, once I have her emptied.
There now—let you get in gently, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” said Mr. Linton, placing his feet with
extreme caution, and coming to rest thankfully in the
stern. “I don’t want to begin the day with a ducking,
and those bottom boards look as if they would crumble
under my weight. Take care, Wally—this is a craft
to be treated with respect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you drowned many in this one?” queried
Jim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Burke emitted a deep chuckle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yerra, you will have your joke, sir!” he said,
making hasty repairs to a rowlock that chiefly consisted
of rusty wire, of which more than one strand
had broken away. “There’s many a good fish killed
in worse boats than this. A lick of paint, now, and
you wouldn’t know her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t call her a boat at all,” retorted Jim,
disposing his long legs so as to avoid, as far as possible,
the steadily increasing dampness in the bottom.
“She’s a hoary antique, and she ought to be in a
museum; but if you say she’ll stay afloat, Patsy,
we’re game. Lend me that baling-tin while you’re
rowing, and I’ll try to discourage the lough from
entering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Linton declined to fish, remarking that he preferred
to be ready to swim when necessary, and would
meanwhile officiate as baler as soon as Jim was ready
to get to work with his rod. Patsy pulled out gently,
until they were clear of rushes. A light wind rippled
the water, sending tiny wavelets lapping against the
sides of the boat; overhead, clouds drifted across a
soft blue sky and now and then blotted out the sun.
The hills sloping down to the lough on three sides were
half shrouded in haze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis a perfect fishing-day,” Patsy pronounced,
shipping his oars and letting the boat drift gently.
“If there was a little more wind itself ye’d soon have
a tremenjious basket of fish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patsy’s predictions were by this time well known to
the Australians. He suffered, as Wally said, from
enthusiasms, and all his geese were swans; so that
his cheerful forecast raised no throb of hope in their
hearts. He had been as cheerful on other mornings,
when they had fished in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t quite see the fascination of it,” Wally
commented, after ten minutes of steady whipping the
water. “It’s so continuous; and you get nothing
for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me a good sinker and a plump slab of clam
for a bait—and the schnapper on the bite,” Jim responded.
“I don’t believe these trout know how
to bite at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t say bite—it’s ‘rise,’ ” said Norah,
gloomily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. Perhaps because they don’t bite.
They certainly don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They do not,” Wally agreed. “Perhaps they
rise and saunter past this queer collection of sham
insects that we dangle on the face of the waters: and
if you have luck you hook them as they go by. Only
we don’t have luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They fished on, sadly, casting with a precision that
won commendation from Mr. Burke, and to which
long practice with a stock whip had probably contributed.
Nothing occurred, except the end of the
lough: whereupon Patsy resumed the oars, rowed to
the end whence they had started, and began up drift
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do people do this all day—for weeks?” Norah
demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yerra, they do, miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what do they do it <span class='it'>for</span>?” Norah said,
desperately. “I don’t see any fun at all. I’m going
to take the oars presently, Patsy, and you can have
my rod.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If ever I put hard-earned pay into contraptions
like this again!” Jim uttered, gazing despondently
on the dainty ten feet green-heart rods, new and
workmanlike with their fresh tackle. “They looked
just top-hole in the shop, and they do still; but that’s
all there is about them. I vote we go and scramble
over a heathery mountain or two, and stop whipping
this old lough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear, hear!” said Wally. “Let’s get Patsy to
put us ashore at the lower end, and we’ll leave the
trout to some one else. I’m blessed if I fish again
until we get back to the creek at Billabong—with a
worm and a sinker, and a nice little cork bobbing on
the top of the water. No science, but you get fish.
These old Irish trout—my aunt!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His reel whirred suddenly under his hand, and his
rod bent double. There was a swirl in the water.
The line ran out sharply, and something that was
living gold in the sunlight leaped, flashed for an instant,
and was gone again. Patsy uttered a howl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave him run, sir!—give and take! Reel in
when the strain is off him. Aisy now, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Off him!” gasped Wally. “Why, he pulls like
a working bullock! Won’t the rod break?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will not,” said Patsy. “Drop the point, sir,
if he leps. Yerra, sure that’s a fine grand trout ye
have—did ye see the great splashing rise he made to
ye? Howld him, sir—he’ll get off on ye if ye slacken
too much. Wind in when ye get a chanst, and bring
him nice and aisy to the boat—I have the net ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring him to the boat!—it’s himself that’s doing
all the bringing!” uttered Wally. “Tell me if I’m
messing it up, Patsy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Begob, you’re doing fine!” said Patsy—“ye’re
playing him beautiful. Give and take, and his head’ll
come up presently—don’t be afraid if he do run from
ye. Oh, murder, there’s the little mistress got one too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah’s reel sang suddenly, and a fish went off
astern. The owner of the rod made a wild effort to
play him sitting down, and then stood up, her rod
describing erratic circles while Mr. Linton grasped her
skirt in a desperate effort to steady her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m all right, daddy!” she gasped. “Oh, such
a beauty—I know he weighs a ton!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him go, miss!” shouted Patsy, rendered
desperate by the hopelessness of coaching two novices
at once. “Give him his head—he’ll come back to ye.
There y’are, sir—did ye see his head come up?—wind
him in! No, not you, miss—let him have his run:
sure that one won’t be tired this long while, by the
looks of him. Oh, murder, sir, is he gone from you?”—as
the trout made a fresh dash for freedom and fled
under the boat. “No,—howld on to the vilyun an’
he’ll be back. Kape a nice, steady strain on him,
miss—give and take.” He hovered over the side,
feverishly grasping the handle of the landing-net.
“Ye have him bet, sir—here he comes. Nice and aisy
does it—don’t hurry him—kape your point up. Back
a little—ah, I have him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The net slipped under Wally’s fish deftly. Simultaneously,
Norah’s trout executed a wild leap, and
Norah reeled him, quite involuntarily, near the boat.
Patsy, responding gallantly to her cry for help, dropped
the first trout hastily, and turned just in time to net
the second, by sheer good luck. The excitement of
the moment overcame him, and Norah’s fish, falling
upon Wally’s, entangled both casts and lines by a few
frantic leaps, before Patsy could collect himself sufficiently
to pounce upon them. The boat rocked with
enthusiasm. Jim had prudently reeled in, to be out
of the way of possible happenings, and stood, beaming,
while the victorious anglers looked at each other with
parted lips and shining eyes, and Mr. Burke wailed
and triumphed alternately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wirra, but them lines is destroyed on us! Oh,
the grand fish, entirely!—would ye get as good now,
sir, with your sinkers and your big lump of bait!
An’ you played ’em fine, both of ye! Lave off flopping,
will ye, and let me get a howlt of the fly—begob,
he have it ate, no less!” Norah’s trout was put out
of its misery by a quick blow on a thwart, and the
fly rescued. “There you are, miss, and he well over
a pound if he’s an ounce!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, daddy, isn’t he a beauty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is, indeed,” Mr. Linton said, looking at the
golden-brown fish, with his splendid spots. “I
never saw a handsomer fellow. Is yours as good
Wally?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betther, I believe,” boomed Patsy, a vision of
triumph. “They might be mates—but Mr. Wally’s
is bigger. Have ye the little spring-balance, sir?
Ye’d ought to weigh them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have it,” Wally said. “Eighteen ounces, Nor,—and
mine’s a pound and a half. Well-l!” He
drew a long breath. “If ever I say a word against
my little rod again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, wasn’t it glorious!” Norah uttered. “Will
those lines ever come clear, Patsy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yerra, they will. Have patience, miss, and I’ll
get them undone in no time. Cast away now, Mr.
Jim—and heaven send he do not land his on the top
of this tangle!” added Mr. Burke, in pious hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurry up, Jim—it’s the best fun since we went
bombing!” said Wally. “Gives you a feeling like
nothing on earth, and the little rod’s just a live thing
in your hands. Glory! there’s one at you—ah, the
brute!” as a big trout rose at Jim’s fly, missed, and
went down, giving a full view of his beautiful speckled
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cast over him again, Mr. Jim—that one’ll come
back,” Patsy whispered. “Gently—ah, that’s the
lovely throw!” The flies settled gently on the water,
but the trout failed to respond. “Thry him again,
sir—that’s it; dhraw them back quiet, now. Begob,
he have him—howld him, sir! Hark at the little
wheel singing: isn’t that the fine run he made!
Wind him in—don’t check him sudden.” Mr. Burke
babbled on happily until the third big trout lay gasping
in the landing-net.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t I tell you there’d be trout in Lough Nacurra?”
he demanded. “Oh, the beauties! them’s
the grand fish, entirely, no matter where you’d be
fishing. Let ye cast out again, sir. Aisy, Miss Norah,
let be—sure I’ll have it for ye quicker than ye would
yourself. There’s the terrible tangle now; ye’d not
get it in a knot like that, not if ye tried for a week.
And is it in Australia you’d get them like that, with
a stick and a sinker and a lump of bait? and play
them too, same as ye did them there? Well, well,
that must be the fine country!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Linton laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh there’s plenty of good trout-fishing in Australia,
Patsy, and plenty of people who use the proper
tackle. But it doesn’t happen to be in our part of
the country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye’ll not beat Irish trout, anywheres in the
world,” said Mr. Burke, shortly. “Them new countries
is all very well in their way, but give me the ould
places I’m after knowing all my life.” He drew a
long breath. “There—I have them untwisted at
last: and more by token, here we are at the end of the
lough.” He fixed Wally with an inquiring gaze. “It
was here you wanted to be landed, sir, wasn’t it?
Will I take down the rod and put you ashore?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally grinned in appreciation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s your game, Patsy,” he admitted, cheerfully.
“I take it all back. If you’ll just hand me that rod
again, you won’t get me off this lough before dark!”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>F</span>ROM that day the spell of the little brown trout
laid itself upon the Australians. The basket
of fish which they carried home with pride in the
evening, and which caused Mrs. Moroney to call upon
the saints to protect her, was the forerunner of many,
since the weather was kind and Lough Nacurra had
profited by its war-time rest to become the happiest
of hunting grounds. Day after day, with and without
Mr. Burke, whose multifarious duties often called
him elsewhere, they visited the little lough in the
bog, until they knew all its best spots as well as Patsy
himself, and were familiar with every inch of the
wooded island where they generally landed for lunch.
With the fever of fishing came to them the patience
which—curiously enough—accompanies it, making
them content to sit hour after hour if rewarded with
an occasional rise: since no lough on this side of
Paradise could be expected to live up to the first
spectacular minutes in which Lough Nacurra had
claimed them for its own. Nevertheless, the little
lough held well; and trout figured largely on the
table for breakfast and dinner, insomuch that Mrs.
Moroney confided to Bridget that ’twas the grand
guests they were to be keeping down the expense—a
remark retailed to Jim by Timsy, in such innocent
certainty that his friend would be pleased, that
Jim could not find it in his heart to rebuke him for
repeating what he was not meant to hear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day by day the air of moorland and mountain
worked the boys’ cure. Strength came back to them
quickly, with long days in the open and long nights
of quiet sleep. War seemed very far away. Papers
came irregularly, and the younger members of the
party were very willing to let Mr. Linton read them
and tell them anything startling, without troubling
about details. Little by little, the horror of the
gas faded; they ceased to dream about it, a nightly
torment which had kept them back for the first weeks.
The regiment was having a much-needed rest in billets:
Anstruther, Garrett, and their other chums were
fit and well, and longing for another chance of coming
to grips with the enemy. Much of the horror of
Gallipoli Mr. Linton succeeded in keeping from them:
too many of their school-fellows lay dead upon that
most cruel of battlefields, and he suppressed the papers
that gave details of the losses. The fog of war always
hangs closely: it was easy to make it hide from his
boys details of the news that had plunged Australia
alike into mourning and into deeper resolve to see
the thing through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Norah and her father the time was an oasis of
peace in a desert of anxiety. Too soon they must
send Jim and Wally back, and themselves return to
work and wait in London. Now, nothing mattered
greatly, and they could try to forget. It was not
the least of David Linton’s happiness that each day
brought back light to Norah’s eyes and colour to her
cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they played about Ireland as they had played
all their lives in Australia. The Irish blood that was
in them made them curiously at home; they liked
the simple, kindly country-folk, and found a ready
welcome in the scattered cottages, where already Norah
had made friends with at least half a dozen babies.
Her education developed on new lines: she picked
up a good deal of Irish, and became steeped in the
innumerable legends of the country, not in the least
realizing that in being told the “ould ancient” stories
she was being paid a compliment for which the average
tourist might sigh in vain,—for the Irish peasant
is jealous of his folk-stories, and seldom tells them
to anyone not of the country. In the great stone
kitchen Mrs. Moroney gave her lessons in the manufacture
of potato-cakes, colcannon, soda-bread, and
other national delicacies, and, with old Nanny the
cook, listened to stories of Australia with frequent
ejaculations of “God help us!” while Jim and Wally
talked much to Patsy Burke and John Conolly, and to
the men in the villages, doing a little recruiting work
as occasion offered. They also talked of Australia,
since they could not help it, and became at times
slightly confused as to the number of men for whom
they had promised to find work after the war, on Billabong,
if possible. However, as Jim said resignedly
if Billabong overflowed with men, there were other
places—Australia was large and empty. They could
all come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you there, Norah? Coo-ee!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An answering “Coo-ee!” came from one of the
mouldering summer-houses in the garden, and Wally
plunged down the overgrown walk in its direction.
Norah was not in the summer-house, which she described
as an insecty place, but cross-legged on a sunny
patch of grass behind it, surrounded by innumerable
letters. The Australian mail had arrived that morning;
and, since mails in war time were apt to be
“hung up” until a ship could be found to take them,
letters were wont to accumulate in alarming quantities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good gracious, are you still reading?” inquired
Wally. “I finished all mine ages ago: not that I
ever get such awful bundles as you do. Jim and
your father are plunged in business letters, and I’m
like Mary’s little lamb, or Bo-Peep’s sheep, or whichever
mutton it was that got lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor old thing!” said Norah, absently. “Never
mind; sit down and read dear old Brownie’s letter.
It takes one straight back to Billabong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s no bad thing—though I’d like to see
a little more of Ireland,” said Wally, subsiding upon
grass. “Poor old Brownie! can’t you see her,
Nor, struggling over this in the kitchen at home.
She’d be so much happier over tackling a day’s baking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She would, indeed,” Norah assented, her eyes
a little misty. She touched the scrawled pages of
the old nurse-housekeeper’s letter, her hand resting
on it as though it were a living thing. Brownie had
been all the mother she had known, and the bond
between them was very close. The ill-written sheets
brought vividly to her the kind old face, beaming
with love as she had always known it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Miss Norah,” began Brownie, with due formality.
Then the formality slumped.</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“My dearie, the place is lost without you all
everyone arsks me as soon as the male comes wots in
the letters and are you coming back soon the hot
whether is over thang goodness and we have had
good rain and the place is lookin splendid all the horses
are in great condishun and Murty says to tell you
Bosun is fit to jump out of his skin Murty won’t let
anyone but himself ride him or Garyowin or Monnuk
or the chesnet colt and it keeps him pretty busy keepin
them all exercised. Black Billy is no better than he
was he is a limb and no mistake it will be a mersy when
Mr. Jim comes back to keep that boy in order and
your Pa too he will not take no notice of anyone else.
We are always wonderin and hopin about the war will it
soon be over and that old Kyser hung and how are
Mr. Jim and Mr. Wally we all know they will fight as
well as any Englishman or any two Germans. But
the best of all will be when the old war is over and you
all come home to Billabong tell Mr. Wally I have not
forgot to make pikelits like he likes they will be waiting
for him we got their photergrafs in uniform and dont
they look beautiful only so grown up I keep thinking
of them just little boys ridin the ponies like they always

darnin they give me to do which it was always a pleasure
I’m sure do they look after you well in that old
London i hope they feed you proply in that big hotel
im told their sheets is always damp do be careful
dearie. We try to look after everything the way the
master and Mr. Jim would like it juring their absence
Murty is sendin word about the stock so i will leave
that part of it aloan the garden is lookin grand the

are well</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Brownie</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Wally put down the letter, after folding it slowly.
Norah, who had read it again over his shoulder, put
out her hand for it and tucked it into the pocket of
her coat. Neither spoke for awhile. Ireland had
faded away: they saw only a long low house with a
garden blazing with roses—a kitchen, spotless and
shining, where an old woman laboured mightily with
the pen. She was a fat old woman, plain and unromantic
and very practical; but the thought of her
brought home-sickness sharply to the boy and girl
sitting on the green slope of Irish turf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s an old brick,” said Wally, presently. “By
Jove, Nor, won’t it be jolly to go back when all this
show is over! It makes one feel sort of jumpy to think
of driving up to Billabong again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’M,” assented Norah, lucidly. Speech was a little
difficult just then. Presently she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Australian mail-days are lovely, but they always
hurt a bit, too. Never mind, we’ll all go home
together some day, and Billabong will go quite mad,
and it will be worth having been away. What do we
do this morning, Mr. Second-Lieutenant Meadows?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t know,” Wally answered. “I think
you’d better choose your own amusement, Miss Linton-of-Billabong,
and I’ll fall in with it meekly. Jim and
your father have shut themselves up with piles of
business letters and stock reports and things like that,
and can’t come out before lunch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bother the old business!” said Norah, inelegantly,
wrinkling her nose, as was her way in deep thought.
“Wally, why shouldn’t we try Lough Anoor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s rather an idea—especially as Patsy’s engaged
to-day, and can’t act as boatman. We could
paddle round and try Lough Anoor by ourselves.
It won’t do Lough Nacurra any harm to have a rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; we’ve fished it pretty steadily lately,”
Norah agreed. “It would be rather fun to try a new
place. I’d like to take Timsy, if you don’t mind,
Wally. He’s such a jolly little chap, and it would
be a tremendous treat for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good idea!” agreed Wally. “Great man, Timsy;
he’ll take charge of us and run the whole show, and
be entirely happy. Will you find him, Nor, while I
get the rods and basket?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timsy was never difficult to find, when the seekers
were the Australians. He was digging his bare brown
toes into the gravel by the front door when Norah and
Wally emerged from the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you busy to-day, Timsy?” asked Norah,
gravely. One of the things that Timsy liked about
these people from the other side of the world was
that they always treated him as an equal in age and
sense, and did not “talk down” to him. He had
bitter memories of an English visitor who had addressed
him as “Little boy,” and of an elderly lady
who had patted him on the head, and called him
“dear.” His blood still boiled when he thought of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not,” he replied. “I’m after catching all
the chickens me mother wants,—and ’twas themselves
give me a fine hunt. Chickens do be always knowing
when they’re wanted to be kilt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you can’t blame them for running,” said
Norah. “No more jobs, Timsy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is not, miss. Me mother’s after telling
me to get out and play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Wally and I are going to fish Lough Anoor,”
Norah said. “We haven’t been there yet, and we
don’t know much about it. Would you care to come,
too, Timsy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swift delight leaped to the small boy’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it me? Sure, wouldn’t I be in your way,
miss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you’ll be very useful,” said Norah. “You’d
to come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like!” said Timsy. Words failed him, and he
could only beam at them speechlessly. As they disappeared
into the house they heard suppressed yelps
of joy, and presently, from the front windows, beheld
Timsy energetically turning handsprings on the path,
in the effort to relieve his overcharged feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took the track across the bog leading to Lough
Nacurra, skirted it, following a sheep-path along the
shore, and mounted a rise. Below them lay the little
lough they sought, a jewel in a setting of gently-rolling
hills. In one corner a number of queer, gnarled objects
showed above the surface of the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are those, Timsy?” Wally asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’s ould limbs of trees, sir; the lough does
be low, and them ould things sticks out. Me daddy
says there was a mighty big forest here, one time:
there’s bog-wood everywhere in this part. There’s a
small little landing-stage near them, where the boat is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They plunged down hill. Arrived at the boat,
Wally whistled long and low.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be a boat, I suppose,” he said, doubtfully.
“Timsy said it was, and he ought to know.
But—Did you ever see anything quite like it, Nor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not,” Norah said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boat was flat-bottomed, clumsily and heavily
built. The paint which had originally declared her a
white vessel had long ago peeled off or faded to a
yellowish grey. She squatted on the water like a
very flat duck, and water lay in her, and evidently
had lain long. There were no oars, and nothing that
could be used to bale. Altogether, no craft could
have looked less tempting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Jim reckoned the boat on Lough Aniller
bad, and the Nacurra one only fit for a museum,”
Wally said. “I’d like him to see this one: it would
do his old heart good. Timsy, how does one row a
boat in this country when there are no oars?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timsy, thus appealed to, gave as his opinion that
the paddles would be up at Michael McCarthy’s house,
beyant; further, that if Patsy knew how the said
Michael McCarthy had the boat left, he’d have him
destroyed. “Let ye sit down, sir, and Miss Norah,
too,” concluded the small boy, shouldering the burden
of the responsibility. “I’ll slip up and bring the
paddles and a baling-tin down in no time at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t,” said Wally, firmly. “I’m in this job,
Timsy. Come along and we’ll interview Mr. McCarthy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That gentleman, however, was from home, his
place being taken by a lame son, who produced two
oars which were not even distantly related to each
other, remarking that his father was wore out with
keeping the boat in order for the gentry, and none
of them coming anigh her. When Wally demanded
a baling-tin, he cast about him a wild glance which
finally rested on an excellent tin dipper which presumably
belonged to his mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Herself is away with the hins—let you take it,”
he said, thankfully. “Hiven send she do not come
back on me before you’d be gone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this pious hope echoing in their ears, the
marauding party withdrew, Timsy racing ahead with
the dipper, lest “herself” should make an untimely
appearance and demand her cherished vessel. When
Norah and Wally arrived at the boat he was baling
furiously, and clung to his job until he was too breathless
to argue the question further with Wally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A flat-bottomed boat, built on elementary principles,
is not the easiest thing to empty. They tilted
her sideways, getting very wet in the process, and
wielded the dipper until it scraped dismally against
the boards; but a large residue of water still lingered,
defying anything but a pump or a bath-sponge, equipment
which they lacked. When they restored her to
an even keel the water slapped dismally across the
sodden bottom boards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid we’ll never get her dry,” Wally said,
ruefully. “Tell you what, Norah—I’ll put in a few
bits of wood, and you can put your feet on them;
that will keep them out of the water, at any rate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wood is scarce in Donegal. There was not a bit
to be found except the tough lumps of bog-wood
sticking out of the water, and of these Wally managed
to secure enough for his purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They aren’t lovely,” he said, looking at the uneven
logs. “Still, they ought to keep your feet dry, and
that’s something.” He worked the unwieldy boat
round until her stern pointed to the shore, so that
Norah could get in without being compelled to walk
along the wet floor. Timsy hopped in, bare-legged
and cheery, and they shoved off, moving gingerly
among the half-submerged wood, which threatened
momentarily to rip a hole in the rotten flooring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d hate to say a word against Ireland,” Wally
remarked. “But you’d wonder why they’d build
the landing-stage in the very middle of a submerged
forest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The stones did be a thrifle more convanient there.”
Timsy offered as a solution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—maybe. Still it would be no great lift to
take them a little further,” said Wally. “Does the
boat never get snagged, Timsy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She do, sir. Many’s the time me daddy’s mended
her, and he at home. There’s no one to do it now, till
I get a bit bigger—Patsy he’s destroyed with work,
he says, and he can’t be lugging tools all this way,
says he. And that Michael McCarthy, he’s no use at
all in the world.” Timsy knitted his brows, a worried
little figure. “It’ll be a good thing when the ould
war is over and all them Germans kilt. Then me
daddy’ll come back and fix everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you rather he hadn’t gone, Timsy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small boy’s lip trembled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Twas awful when he went. Me mother cried,
and so did old Nanny and Bridget. But me mother
and me daddy they says there’s no dacint man can
stop out of it. I wisht I was big enough to go too.
Will they take drummer-boys in your regiment, Mr.
Wally? I’m pretty big when I howld meself straight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid you’ve got to be a bit bigger yet, old
man,” Wally told him. “But you’ve got to be here,
to keep an eye on the place; it must be a great comfort
to your daddy to know you’re here, to look after
your mother. There must be a certain number of
fellows at home to mind Ireland in case the Germans
should send troops here, you know; so we leave those
at home who are too young or too old to march fast,
and carry heavy loads, and do rough digging. You’re
doing your bit as long as you’re helping at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that so, truly?” said Timsy, much cheered.
“And could I go when I’m bigger?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you could, if the war is still there,”
Wally answered, cheerfully. “Only we hope it won’t
be. You’ll be able to fight much better in the next
war if you have your daddy home to train you first.
It isn’t every fellow who can have a sergeant all on
himself to train him, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d be in great luck, wouldn’t I?” said the small
boy, hopefully. “But sure, we’ll all be in the heighth
of luck once we get daddy home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally had poled the old boat out of the submerged
trees, with many a bump and scrape that made him
look apprehensively at the boards. The gaunt and
stunted tree-ghosts ceased, and the water deepened,
so he took to the oars. They pulled up against a
freshening breeze to the head of the lough, where
Wally shipped the paddles thankfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a great pair of oars,” said he. “One
weighs a ton and the other only a hundredweight, so
pulling becomes a matter of scientific adjustment.
Well, we’ll drift down, Nor, and see what Lough
Anoor holds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the little lough held trout was made clear
within the first five minutes, when a fish rose at Norah,
who struck too hard and missed it, to her intense disgust.
Luck favoured her, however, for it was a hungry
trout and came at her gamely on the next cast, this
time departing with an annoying mouthful of steel
and feathers instead of the plump fly he had hoped
to engulf. He came to the surface after an exciting
few minutes, and, being very thoroughly hooked,
survived three ineffectual attempts by Wally to get
the landing-net under him. The fourth landed him
in the bottom of the boat, both operators slightly
breathless, while Timsy, scarlet with excitement,
jigged on his seat and uttered sage counsel which
no one heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Awfully sorry, Nor,—I nearly lost that fellow
for you,” Wally exclaimed. “Scooping up a jumping
fish with that old net is much harder than playing
him, I think: I have the utmost respect for Patsy
every time he uses it. Never saw him make a mistake
yet. I say, young Norah, what’s the good of my
putting down a floor of bog-wood for you? Your
feet are soaking!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah glanced down, still flushed with the pride
of capture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, truly,” she said, laughing. “You see,
I can’t possibly play a fish sitting down; I’ve just
<span class='it'>got</span> to stand up. And I tried to stand on those old
lumps of wood, but they simply turned over and
deposited me in the water. Never mind, Wally, it
isn’t the first time I’ve had wet feet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t go and collect a cold, or your father and
Jim will have my blood,” said Wally, doubtfully.
“You’ll have to land and run about if you get chilly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I said, ‘Land my grandmother!’ it would be
rude, so I won’t,” said Norah, who was casting again
vigorously. “Quick, Wally, there’s a rise near you!”—and
Mr. Meadows forgot prudence in the excitement
of trout. At the end of the drift the basket held four
fish, while a fifth had made his escape at the very
edge of the boat, and was doubtless in some snug hole,
reflecting on the Providence which helps little trout
by entrusting the landing-net to inexperienced hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind had risen, and to pull the heavy, water-logged
old boat up the lough was no easy task. There
was no rudder, and she steered very badly, her awkwardness
intensified by the unequal oars. The waves
slapped against her side, and occasionally flung in a
little cloud of spray, and she leaked fast. Norah
baled energetically, with poor results.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a noble vessel,” said Wally, pulling with a
will. “Feel her wallow in the trough of these silly
little waves. I guess we’ll call her ‘The Walloping
Window-Blind,’ Nor, after the boat in the song.
Can you swim, Timsy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot, sir,” said Timsy, grinning. “Sure
that one won’t sink on us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blest if I know,” Wally answered, doubtfully.
“I wouldn’t be surprised at any old thing she’d do.
Anyhow, Miss Norah and I can rescue you if she
goes down; and the water isn’t very cold. Timsy,
did you ever hear the sergeant’s opinion of this boat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timsy’s grin widened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did, sir,” he said, with probably prudent reticence.
“Sure, there’s no one does be liking her in
these parts. She’s not an aisy puller at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True for you,” said Wally, panting. “Thank
goodness, here’s the end of the lough. Hurry up,
Nor, she’ll drift back quickly before this wind, and
they ought to be rising.” His flies whistled out over
the dancing water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’d let me have the net itself I could be landing
the fish for you,” said Timsy, eagerly. “I’ve
landed ’em for me daddy many a time—he taught me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good man—what the sergeant taught you is good
enough for us,” said Wally. “Stand by, then—I’ve
got a beauty on. He’s pulling like fury.” He played
the fish dexterously, his keen, brown face eager.
“Come on, you monster—I’d bet he weighs a pound,
Norah! Ready, Timsy?—he’s about done—ah, good
kid!” as the small boy slipped the net under the
struggling fish with all the deftness of Mr. Burke himself.
“Oh, a beauty! And to think we used to
imagine that a hand-line was sport!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You live and learn,” said Norah, sagely. “That’s
the biggest yet, Wally, and didn’t he fight! Oh, I’ve
got one!—be ready, Timsy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timsy crouched, alert, his hard little hand gripping
the net. The fish was a strong one and fought hard
for his life; again and again he ran the line out, even
when almost at the side of the boat. Norah reeled
him in at last, almost done, but still fighting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, be careful, and he lepping!” Timsy uttered.
“If you take the strain off when he’s hooked slightly
he’ll get off on you. Isn’t he the great fighter entirely!
Quick, miss, I’ll get him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dived at him with the net. The trout leaped
to one side, a wave hiding his flashing golden-brown
body; and Timsy, following a thought too far, overbalanced,
and shot head first into the water. Wally,
casting in the bow, did not see. Norah had a moment’s
vision of the slight childish body as the brown water
closed over him. He had not uttered a sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wally, quick—the oars!” she gasped, dropping
her rod. The boat was drifting fast before the wind.
She watched, knowing that Timsy would be far beyond
their reach when he came to the surface. Then
the little head appeared for an instant and she sprang
into the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A year earlier, Wally would have followed without
a thought. But training and experience had steadied
him; he knew that in the boat he would be far more
use than in the rough water, with the wind taking the
‘Walloping Window-Blind,’ their one refuge, swiftly
away from them. He flung himself at the oars and
steadied her, watching, his heart in his mouth. Norah
swam like a fish, he knew; but the water was rough,
and Timsy would be a dead weight, even supposing
that she had been able to grip him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, to his utter relief, the two heads broke the
water together. He heard Norah’s voice: “Hold my
shoulder, Timsy—you’re all right. Don’t be scared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be beside you in a second, Nor,” Wally shouted.
“Just keep paddling.” He pulled the clumsy boat
frantically up the lough, and let her drop down to
Norah, shipping the oars as he reached her. Leaning
over, he gripped Timsy firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on to the kid, and I’ll pull you both to the
boat,” he said. “Can you catch it?—I’ve got him.”
He waited until Norah’s hand gripped the side.
“That’s right—let him go. Come on, Timsy.” He
hauled the silent small boy into the boat and turned
back to Norah. “Hang on to me, old girl—thank
goodness we can’t pull this old tub over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a struggle, and Norah came over the side,
scrambling in with difficulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Timsy all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am, miss,” said a small voice, between chattering
teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally flung off his coat, and wrapped it round the
child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor old chap—that will keep the wind off you a
bit,” he said. “Norah, get hold of the oars and pull
in—you’ll be nearly as quick as I would be, and it
will keep you warmer. My Aunt! that kid hung
on to the landing-net all the time! Well, you are
a good sort, Timsy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno why would I let it go,” shivered Timsy.
“Bad enough for me to be such an omadhaun, to be
falling in—and herself going after me! Me mother’ll
be fit to tear the face off me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll be too glad to see you alive,” said Wally,
reassuringly. “We’ll——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timsy interrupted him with a cry. He caught
Norah’s neglected rod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Howly Mother, but the fish is in it yet!” he
shouted. “Oh, will ye come, please, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They landed the trout between them, Timsy recovering
some measure of his self-respect by being
allowed to use the net.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had it nearly swallowed—if he hadn’t, he’d
have been gone this long time,” he chattered, watching
Wally disengage the hook. “Isn’t it the grand luck
we’re in! and he the beautifullest trout! Oh, why
would I want to be falling in, and the fish rising!”
He looked wistfully at Norah. “Tis all wet ye are,
and the day spoilt on ye,” he said, sadly. “You won’t
never take me out again, Miss Norah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t we just!” said Norah, smiling at him
through a tangle of wet hair. “We don’t get out
of friends because of a trifle like that, Timsy.” She
brought the “Walloping Window-Blind” floundering
against the shore. “There! it would warm an iceberg
to pull that old tub. Come along, Timsy, and I’ll
race you home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally put a detaining hand on her arm as he turned
from securing the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure you’re all right, Nor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right as—as anything,” said Norah, laughing at
the anxious face. “I believe you’re growing careful,
Wally—what’s come to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all very well,” said Wally, unhappily. “Do
you think it’s jolly for a fellow to see you pitching
into a beastly lough? And I’m going home dry, and
you and the kid wet. If there was any sense in it
I’d jump in and get wet, too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only there isn’t,” said Norah—“and it was
lucky for the two wet ones that you were dry in the
boat. An old and hardened warrior like you ought
to have more common sense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I ought,” said Wally, relapsing into a
smile. “Only .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, well. Now we’ve got to
run, or we’ll never catch young Timsy.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE words came floating down the hillside at
the top of a cheery young baritone. Also
down the hillside came sounds of haste—heavy footsteps,
crashing undergrowth, and rustling of bracken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hill sloped steeply, ending with an abrupt
plunge into a boreen below: a little winding lane,
walled in by high banks, clad with heather and furze,
and all abloom with wild flowers. The main road
ran westward, dusty and hot in the June sunlight;
but the boreen was all in shade, twisting its way in
and out between the hills. The dew was yet on its
grass, though in the blossoming furze above, fringing
the banks, the bees droned heavily, winging their
busy way among the hot sweetness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The noise overhead came nearer, and there came
into the song staccato notes never intended by the
composer, as the singer half-slid, half-plunged, down
the hillside, taking inequalities in the ground with
long strides. Nevertheless, the voice persevered,
happy, if disjointed, until it was just above the boreen.
Then the song and the hurrying footsteps ceased together,
and there was a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wire!” said Wally’s disgusted tones. “And
barbed, at that! Didn’t we have enough in France!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wire was half-hidden in the tangle of grass and
furze; a tense strand twanged as his boot caught it
in clambering over. His thin face showed for a
moment, peeping over into the boreen. There was
nothing to do but slither, and slither he did, landing
in the little lane with a mighty thud, and bringing
with him a shower of furze blossoms, and clattering
stones and clods. They fell close to a man sitting
on a fragment of rock and leaning back against the
bank. He had not stirred at the commotion overhead,
and now he sat motionless, looking up at the
tall lad with a faint smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon!” said Wally, abashed. “I
say. I hope nothing hit you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man on the boulder shook his head. It was a
big head, with a wide brow and lines of pain round the
eyes; but he was a small man, and the hand lying
on the knee of his rough tweed suit was startlingly
thin. Even as he leaned back against the bank it
was easy to see that his shoulders were misshapen and
humped. Wally glanced once, and withdrew his eyes
hurriedly, with a boy’s instinctive dread of appearing
to notice anything amiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beastly careless of me!” he said, apologetically.
“I never thought of anyone being down below.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you gave enough warning that you were
coming,” said the man. “Anyone remaining below
did so entirely at his own risk. Do you always come
down a hill in that fashion, may I ask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not always,” he admitted. “But it was a jolly
hill; and it had taken me such a time to climb up it
that I had a fancy to see how quickly I could get
down. And I was feeling awfully fit. It’s so jolly
to be feeling well—makes you act like a kid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be jolly,” said the other, laconically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally flushed hotly, in dread of having hurt him.
It was painfully clear that to feel well was not a common
experience for the man on the boulder. He had
a sudden wild desire to undo the impression of exuberant
health and spirits. The tired eyes were even
harder to face than the twisted shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Been an awful crock, really,” he said, sitting
down on another fragment of rock. “Gassed—over
there.” He nodded vaguely in the direction—more
or less—of Europe. “Makes you feel like nothing
on earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s pretty bad, isn’t it?” asked the other, with
swift interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather. We didn’t get anything like a full dose,
of course, or we wouldn’t be here. But even a little
is rather beastly. And the worst of it is, that it
hangs on to you long after you’re better—it seems to
lurk down somewhere inside you, and gets hold of you
just as you’re beginning to think you’re really all
right. It actually makes a fellow think he’s got
nerves!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t look like it,” said the man, laughing
for the first time. The brown, boyish face did not
suggest such attributes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it truly does make one pretty queer,” said
Wally, laughing too. “However, I believe we’ve
nearly got rid of it—this country of yours is enough
to make us forget it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re Australian, aren’t you?” the man asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally nodded. “How did you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, this is a little place,” said the other. “Strangers
are our only excitement, and since the war started
we haven’t had nearly so many. All the people who used
to come here to fish are away fighting.” He sighed.
“Most of them will not come back any more. You
were quite a godsend to us. Your boatman told one
of my men about you; and the baker’s boy tells
the cook; and the butcher tells every one; and the
postmistress is simply full of news about you. As
for the shops, they are fairly buzzing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, there are only two,” said Wally, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s why they buzz,” said the man. “I don’t
go into shops, myself; but I have been altogether
unable to repress the delighted confidences of my
chauffeur. He tells me that you’re all very keen
fishermen——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And don’t know a thing about it!” said Wally.
“Did he tell you that, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said you were getting on,” said the other,
guardedly, his eyes twinkling. The chauffeur’s confidences
had probably been ample. “But your stories
of Australia have them all fascinated, and if they
weren’t—most of them—grandfathers, they would
probably emigrate in a body. Thank goodness,
though, we’ve not many slackers here: almost all
our young men are fighting. My chauffeur, poor lad,
lost a leg at Ypres. His wooden leg is fairly satisfactory,
but of course he can’t go back, much as he
wants to. We’re nearly all old men or—cripples”—his
voice was suddenly bitter: “and it’s rather pleasant
to see young faces again. You bring the stir of
the world with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve had so much stir that we were uncommonly
glad to get away from it,” Wally answered. “And
this is a jolly place; if there were more big timber
it would be nearly as good as our bush-country.” He
paused, cheerfully certain of having paid Ireland the
highest possible compliment: then he rose. “I must
be getting back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man on the boulder rose also, slowly. When
he stood up, his crooked shoulders became more evident.
He took one or two steps slowly and painfully.
Then he staggered, stretching an uncertain hand
towards the bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I help you?” It was impossible to pretend
any longer not to notice: he was swaying, and Wally
was beside him with a swift stride. The other caught
at the strong young arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” he said, presently. There were
drops of perspiration on his brow, but his voice was
steady. “I’m something of a crock myself, and
this happens to be one of my bad days. I came up
here because I couldn’t stand the car any more—it’s
waiting for me on the road. If you would not mind
helping me——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went along the boreen slowly, between the
blossoming banks. The man rested heavily on Wally’s
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure I’m not tiring you?” he asked, once.
“You’re not fit yourself, yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m all right,” Wally answered. “Please
lean as much as you like. Would you like a rest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—we’re nearly there. And I’m better.” His
face was white, but he smiled up at the tall boy. Then
a turn in the lane brought the high road in view, and,
drawn up by the side, a big touring-car. The chauffeur,
drowsing in his seat in the sun, became suddenly
awake. He limped quickly towards his master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure I knew you had no right to be going up there
alone,” he said, reproachfully. “Will you give me
the other arm, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m all right, Con. This gentleman has helped
me splendidly.” But he put a hand on the chauffeur’s
sleeve, more, Wally fancied, to pacify him than because
he needed extra help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the car, he leaned back with a sigh of relief. It
was luxuriously padded, and there were special cushions
that the chauffeur adjusted with a practised hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Awfully sorry to have been such a nuisance,”
he said. “Thanks ever so much; you saved me a
rather nasty five minutes.” He looked wistfully at
Wally. “I suppose you wouldn’t come home with
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally hesitated. He wanted badly to get back
to his party and to the trout that were so tantalizing
and so engrossing. But there was something hard
to resist in the tired eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would be doing me a real kindness,” said
the other. “I can send word to your friends——”
He broke off. “Oh, it’s hardly fair to ask you—you
didn’t come here to muddle about with a sick man.
Never mind—I’ll get you to come over some day when
I’m more fit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to,” said Wally, cheerfully; “but I’m
coming now, as well, if I may.” He hopped into the
car, and sat down. “If you could let them know, I
should be glad—they may be waiting for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are they?—at the hotel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, they’re fishing Lough Nacurra. I said I
would turn up about twelve and hail them; it’s Australian
mail-day, and I’ve been posting the family’s letters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If doesn’t seem fair to keep you,” said the car’s
owner. “But these days I dread my own company.
So if you’ll come to lunch with me I’ll send you back
to them in good time to get a few trout before the
evening. Home, Con.” The car started gently, and
he leaned back and closed his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally felt slightly bewildered. Here was he, in
company with a man whose name he did not know, and
who was apparently going to sleep—both of them
being whisked through the peaceful Irish landscape
at an astonishing rate of speed in a motor which surpassed
anything he had ever imagined in luxury of
fittings. It was a very large car: four people could
easily have found room in the seat he shared with his
silent host, and there were, in addition, three little
arm-chairs which folded flat when not in use. It was
splendidly upholstered, and there were electric lamps
in cunning places, and many of what Wally termed
“contraptions”; pockets and flaps for holding papers,
a clock and speedometer, and a silver vase in which
nodded two perfect roses. Wally infinitely preferred
horses to motors: but this was indeed a motor
to be respected, and he gazed about him with frank
interest, which did not abate when he found that his
host was looking at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was admiring your car,” he said. “It’s a
beauty; I don’t think I ever saw such a big one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I use it as a bedroom very often,” said the
other. “I like knocking about in it; and I hate
hotels; so Con and I live in the car when we go touring,
and he cooks for me, camp-fashion. This seat makes
a very good bed; and I have various travelling fixtures
that screw on here and there when they are
needed, or live under the seat. I planned it myself,
and I don’t think there’s a foot of waste space in it.
Con sleeps in the front seat. We have an electric
cooker, and he turns out uncommonly good meals.
Of course, if we encounter really bad weather we have
to put in for shelter, but I’m glad to say that doesn’t
often happen to us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How jolly!” Wally exclaimed. “I suppose
you’ve been all over Ireland in that way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ireland—Scotland—England: and most of Europe
and America,” said his host. “I’m an idle man, you
see, and travelling, if I can do it in my own fashion,
makes amends for a good many things I can’t have.”
The weariness came back into his face. “I might as
well introduce myself,” he said; “I forgot that I had
kidnapped you without the civility of telling you my
name, which is O’Neill—John O’Neill. I live at
Rathcullen House, where we shall be in another minute
or two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Memory came back to Wally of a road perched
above the lough, and of a little runabout car driven by a
man in motor-goggles: and of the boatman’s confidences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’re Sir John O’Neill?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—the first part of it doesn’t matter. The
line goes back a good way, but I’m the last of it. But
the old house is rather jolly; I hope you will all come
and see it as often as you can spare the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The car swung off the road as he spoke, and through
a great gateway where beautiful gates of wrought
iron stood open between massive stone pillars. A
little gabled lodge, with windows of diamond lattice-work,
was just within: a pleasant-faced woman in
pursuit of a fleeing mischievous child stopped, smiled,
and dropped a curtsey, while the three-year-old atom
she had been chasing bobbed down in ridiculous imitation,
her elfish face breaking into smiles in its tangle
of dark curls. John O’Neill smiled in return; and
the car sped on smoothly, up a wide avenue lined
with enormous beech-trees, arching and meeting overhead
so that they seemed to be driving into a tunnel
of perfect green. Between their mighty trunks Wally
caught glimpses of a wide park, where little black
Kerry cattle grazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For over a mile the avenue ran its winding way
through the park. Then the trees ceased, and they
came out into a clear space of terraced lawn, blazing
with flower-beds, and sloping down to a lake fringed
with ornamental plants, and dotted with many-coloured
water-lilies, among which paddled lazily
some curious waterfowl which Wally had never seen.
Beyond the lawn stood a long grey house; a house
of old grey stone, of many gables, clad in ivy and
Virginia creeper. Even to the Australian boy’s eyes
it was mellow with the dignity of centuries. It was
not imposing or majestic, like the old houses he had
seen in England; but about it hovered an atmosphere
of high breeding and of quiet peace: a house of memories,
tranquil in its beauty and in its dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The car came to rest gently beside a stone step, and
in an instant a white-haired old butler was at the
door, offering his arm to his master. John O’Neill
got out slowly, and limped up the steps to the great
doorway, where an Irish wolf-hound stood, looking
at him with liquid eyes of welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say—what a jolly dog!” Wally uttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he’s rather a nice old chap,” said his host.
“Shake hands, Lomair”; and the big dog put a paw
gravely into Wally’s hand. He followed his master
into the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great square hall was panelled with old oak,
almost black in the subdued light within. A staircase,
with wide, shallow steps, wound its way in a long
curve to a gallery overhead: and at the far end, an
enormous fireplace was filled with evergreens. Eastern
rugs lay on the polished oaken floor; in one corner a
stand of flowering plants made a sheet of colour. On
the walls were splendid heads—deer of many kinds,
markhor, ibex, koodoo, and two heads with enormous
spreading antlers, stretching, from tip to tip, fully
eleven feet. They drew an exclamation from Wally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They belonged to the old Irish elk,” O’Neill explained.
“He must have been a pretty big fellow;
a pity civilization proved too much for him. He has
been extinct thousands of years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fancy seeing a herd of those fellows!” Wally
exclaimed, gazing in admiration at the noble head.
“But however would he get those antlers through
timber?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think he frequented forests much,” O’Neill
said. “The plains suited him better. But he must
have been able to lay his horns right back—all deer
can do that when necessary. I dare say he could dodge
through trees at a good rate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he looks as if he could hardly have got
through the doorway of a Town Hall,” Wally commented.
“You have a splendid lot of heads. Did
you shoot them yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A few—I can’t do much stalking,” O’Neill said.
“I got those two tigers, but that was from the back
of an elephant. My father shot most of the others;
he was a mighty hunter. The trout were mine”—he
indicated some huge stuffed specimens, in glass
cases, on the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re splendid,” Wally said, regarding his host
with much admiration. “And you actually shot the
tigers! Was it very exciting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—the trout took far more killing. The elephants
and the beaters did most of the work so far
as the tigers were concerned; it was only a sort of
arm-chair performance on my part. I simply sat in a
fairly comfortable howdah and fired when I was told
to do so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds simple, but—well, I’d like to have the
chance. And you must have shot straight,” Wally
said. He glanced from the grim masks to the slight
figure with ungainly shoulders, marvelling in his heart
at the contrast between hunter and hunted. At the
moment John O’Neill did not look capable of killing
a mouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dropped in to a big arm-chair, motioning Wally
to another. The colour was returning to his face,
and his eyes began to lose their pain-filled expression.
In the big chair’s depths he looked smaller than ever;
but his eyes were very bright, and soon Wally forgot
his morning’s fishing and altogether lost sight of his
host’s infirmities in the fascination of his talk. Half-crippled
as he was, he had been everywhere, and done
many things that stronger men long vainly to do. He
had travelled widely, and not as the average tourist,
who skims over many experiences without gathering
the cream of any. John O’Neill had gone off the
beaten track in search of the unusual, and he had
found it in a dozen different countries. He had hunted
and fished; had shot big game in India and made
his way up unknown rivers in South America, until
sickness had forced him to abandon enterprise and
return to civilization to save his life. Wandering in
the bypaths of the world, he had brought home a
harvest of queer experiences; he told them simply,
with a twinkle in his eye and a quick joy in the humorous
that often left his hearer shaking with laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally listened in growing wonderment and a great
sense of pity. If this man, so cruelly handicapped,
had already done so much, what might he not have
done, given a straight and sound body! Yet how he
had accomplished even the tenth part of what he had
done was a mystery. Wally looked at the frail, slight
figure with respectful amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John O’Neill broke off presently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I rattle along at a terrible rate when I’m lucky
enough to find a listener,” he said. “And lately I’ve
been horribly sick of my own society. You see, they
wouldn’t have me in any capacity at the Front; I
offered to do anything, and I did think they might
have let me drive an ambulance; but an ambulance
driver over there really has to be a hefty chap, able
to put his shoulder literally to the wheel when a
road goes to pieces in front of him, owing to a shell
lobbing on it; and of course they said I wouldn’t do,
so soon as they looked at me. So I went to London
and did Red Cross work and recruiting—and overdid
it, like a silly ass. Broke down, and had to crawl
home and be ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hard luck!” said Wally, sympathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stupidity, you mean,” remarked his host. “A
man ought to know when he has had enough, whether
it’s work or beer. But it’s not easy to stand aside
when all the lucky people—like you—are playing the
real game. At best, mine was only an imitation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t agree with you,” Wally said, warmly.
“We can’t all fight—the rest of the country has to
carry on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, there are enough slackers and shirkers
to do that,” O’Neill said. “And anyhow, I couldn’t
even carry on at what I did attempt to do. Never
mind—tell me your own adventures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally’s story of war did not take long in the telling;
but he spun it out as much as possible, switching from
war to Australia in response to the eager questions of
the man in the big leather chair. John O’Neill was a
curious blending: at one moment almost savagely
cynical and despondent, as his own physical handicap
weighed upon him: at the next, laughing like a boy,
and full of a boy’s keen interest in what he had not
seen. Australian talk held him closely attentive:
it was almost the only corner of the world that he
had not visited, but he meant to go there, he said,
after the war. Travelling by sea was unpleasant enough
at any time without the added chance of an impromptu
ducking if a submarine or a mine came across you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do they all buck—your horses?” he asked.
“I can ride a bit, but a buckjumper would be beyond
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally reassured him as to the manners of Australian
steeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a general impression in England that we
all live in red shirts, in the bush, and ride fiery, untamed
steeds,” said he, laughing. “It goes with
the universal belief that all Australia is tropical. I’ve
tried to tell fellows in England that there are parts
of Australia where we have a pretty decent imitation
of Swiss winter sports—skiing, skating, and all the
rest of it; but they look on me with polite disbelief.
They can’t—or won’t—understand that Australia
stretches over enough of the map to have a dozen
different kinds of climate. Not that it matters, anyhow;
I don’t think we expect people to be wildly
interested in us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll know more about you by the time the war is
over,” his host suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—I suppose so. Lots of our fellows will come
to London; we’re all awfully keen to see it, and it’s
a great chance for us. I only hope we shall take a
lot of your men back with us; they’re falling over
each other in England—or will be, once the war is
over: and we want them. We needed them badly
enough before the war: afterwards it will be worse
than ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you preach emigration in Ireland,” said
O’Neill, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? They emigrate, whether you preach
or not; only they go to America and Canada, because
they’re near and there’s nothing between them and
Ireland. They would probably do much better if
they would come to Australia, only they don’t know
a thing about it. I told one old woman a few things
about Australia and wages there, and all she could
say was, ‘God help us!’ When I’d finished, she
said. ‘And Australy’d be somewhere in Americy,
wouldn’t it, dear?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you say, ‘God help us’?” laughed O’Neill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might have,” grinned Wally. “They know
Canada—but then, look what Canada is!” He gave
a mock shiver—Wally had been reared in hot Queensland.
“As one Canadian chap said to me, after
visiting our irrigation settlements—‘I don’t know
why people come to us instead of to you: just look
at the climate you’ve got—and we have three seasons
in the year—July, August, and winter!’ But I suppose
they seem nearer home, and they can’t realize
that when you once get on a ship you might as well
be there for a month as a week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The white-haired butler announced luncheon, and
they found the table laid in the bow-window of a long
and lofty room, whence could be seen the park, ending
in a glimpse of bog and heather, with a flash of blue
that meant a little lough caught among the hills.
Afterwards, they strolled out on the terrace and
through the scented garden to the stables, where two
fine hunters and some useful ponies made friends with
Wally instantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Government took most of my horses when
war broke out; but I managed to keep these two,”
said O’Neill, his hand on an arching neck while a soft
muzzle sought in his pocket for a carrot. “I’d sooner
have paid what they were worth than let them go;
they’re too good for war treatment, unless it were
absolutely necessary. And thank goodness this is not
a war of horses. Would you care to try one of these
fellows, some day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t I!” said Wally, beaming. “And—could
Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course—and what about Jim’s sister? Does
she ride?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She does,” said Wally, suppressing a smile at that
incomplete statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rides anything that ever looked through a bridle,
I suppose,” said his host, watching him. “She looks
a workmanlike person. That brown pony is pretty
good; she might like him. I can show you all a bit
of Irish jumping—ditches and banks instead of your
fly fences.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll probably fall off,” said Wally, with conviction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ll find the falling softer than in Australia,”
O’Neill said, consolingly. “But I don’t fancy
you will give us much fun that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The motor waited at the hall door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Con will drop you near your people,” O’Neill
said. “I’d like to come with you—but if I overdo
things to-day I’ll pay to-morrow; and I’m anxious to
see the last of this attack. Will you tell Mr. Linton
I hope to call on him in a few days?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll be awfully glad to see you,” Wally said.
“And thanks ever so for giving me such a good time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Neill laughed. “Is it me now, to be giving you
a good time?” he said. “I thought ’twas the other
way round it was. You have helped me through a stiff
day, and I’m very grateful.” He shook hands warmly,
and the motor whirred away.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>‟W</span>ELL—of all the deserters!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it me?” asked Wally, modestly.
He made an enormous stride from a half-submerged
stone into the boat, and nearly lost his balance, collapsing
in the stern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You!” said Jim, steadying the boat, which endeavoured,
under the assault, to bury her nose in a
muddy bank of rushes. “You, that was going to
catch several hundred trout, and instead cleared
out——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a plutocratic motor,” said Norah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a bloated aristocrat,” added Jim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And never said good-bye!” finished Mr. Linton,
with an artistic catch in his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did,” said Wally: “I did it all. And I didn’t
want to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sounds of disbelief rose from his hearers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t snort,” said the victim, inelegantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think it betters your case to describe our
just indignation as snorting,” said Mr. Linton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you were to grovel it would become you better,”
said Norah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in this boat,” hastily remarked her father.
“It isn’t planned for gymnastics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s too well-fed to grovel, anyhow,” said Jim
brutally. “What did you have in the ducal castle,
Wal? ortolans and plovers’ eggs, and things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chops,” said Wally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shades of Australia!” ejaculated Mr. Linton.
“Is that what one eats in company with dukes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” Wally answered, patiently. “He
isn’t a duke, anyhow. Where did you people get
your soaring ideas?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From a lame chauffeur who seemed to think you
were getting a great deal more than you deserved——”
Jim began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I’m getting now!” said Wally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he said you had gone off in the mothor to
the big house. We inferred from his tone that it was
not merely big, but enormous. The master had tuk
you, he said; we further gathered that you might
come back when the master had finished with you.
It sounded rather like Jack and the Giant, and if we
had known who had kidnapped you we might have
organized a search party. As we didn’t, we caught
trout—lots of ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you, indeed?” said Wally, with open envy.
“Lucky beggars—I wish I had!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you rioting in baronial halls!” said Norah.
“Some people don’t know when they are well off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we let Wally have a word in edgeways for a
few minutes we might find out a little more about the
baronial halls,” said Mr. Linton. “Tell us what
happened to you, Wally. Was it a duke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not—only a poor hump backed chap with
some sort of a handle to his name. He’s Sir John
O’Neill, and he has a lovely place; but you never saw
a man with less ‘frill,’ ” Wally remarked. “Simple
as anyone could be. And I don’t think I’ve ever
been so sorry for anyone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he badly crippled?” Jim asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—only he seems awfully delicate, and subject
to beastly fits of illness. He’s got any amount of
pluck—rides and shoots and fishes, and has motored
half over the world. But of course he’s terribly handicapped;
the wonder is that he has done half as much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That must be the man Patsy was talking about—only
he called him the young masther,” Norah said.
“Is he quite young?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’d put him down at about forty,” said Wally,
to whom that age was close on senile decay: “I
think the old hands here would call a man the young
master until he died of old age. He’s queer: at times
he’s like a kid; and then I suppose the pain gets hold
of him, because, in a minute he seems to grow quite
old, and he drops laughing and gets bitter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor fellow!” said Mr. Linton. “How did you
find him, Wally?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I nearly fell on top of him getting down a
bank into a lane,” Wally answered. “He was sitting
on a stone, hating himself, but he didn’t seem to mind
my sudden appearance at all, though I’m sure
clods hit him. Then we yarned, and I helped him
back to his car, and he got me to go back to lunch
with him—I didn’t want to, but——” He was silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect he was glad of someone to talk to,” Mr.
Linton said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it—he’s just as lonely as he can be. All
his people are fighting, and he’s knocked himself out
over Red Cross work, and has had to come back to
Ireland and get fit. He’s coming to call on you, sir—and
he wants us all to go over to Rathcullen—his
place—as much as we can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m,” said Jim and Norah, together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish baronial halls appealed more to my family,”
said Mr. Linton, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t mean to be horrid; but trout and loughs
and bogs appeal so much more,” said Norah. “Of
course we’ll go, if he wants us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s a jolly place, and he’s horribly lonely,”
Wally answered. “And I don’t know about his halls
being baronial, but certainly his stables are: they’re
simply topping. He hasn’t many horses left—the
Government took most of them for the war; but there
are two ripping hunters, and some extra good ponies.
And he wants to lend ’em to us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh!” said Jim, sitting up. “Wally, my child,
how did you manage it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t have to,” said Wally, grinning. “He
simply threw them at me. Asked me if you could
ride, Norah, so I suggested that if he had a quiet
donkey it might do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have one that is not quiet,” said Norah, regarding
him with a fixed eye. “Tell me the truth,
Wally—is there something I can ride?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait till you see it—that’s all. And he’s going
to teach us to jump banks and ditches and things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh-h!” said Norah, blissfully, “I said this place
only wanted horses to make it perfect!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now you’re going to have the horses, little as
you both deserve ’em,” said Wally; “and now, perhaps,
you’ll all apologize humbly for calling me unpleasant
names!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not,” Jim said, firmly. “If you didn’t
deserve them at the moment (and I’m not sure that
you didn’t), you’re sure to deserve them before long.
Never mind, look at this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened his fishing-basket carefully and showed a
mass of damp grass, among which could be seen
glimpses of many trout. Jim dived in with his finger
and thumb, and drew out a speckled beauty, which he
dangled before Wally’s envious gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pound and a half, by my patent spring-balance!”
he declared, triumphantly. “I played him for what
seemed like three hours, and I never was so scared
of anything in my life. He got tired at last, however,
and Norah officiated with the landing-net.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and missed him twice,” said Norah, shame-faced.
“It was the greatest wonder he didn’t get off.
But a big trout on the end of a little line does wobble
so much when it’s coming towards the net. It’s
much worse than a screwing ball at tennis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know—and you feel perfectly certain the line
is going to break, if the rod doesn’t,” Wally said. “I
feel like that over a quarter-pounder: I don’t know
how you ever managed to make a collected effort for
that big fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t collected at all—I just swiped wildly,
and got him by the sheerest good luck,” Norah answered.
“I mean to practise with a cricket ball on a
string, hung from the big tree outside my window: it
would be awful to miss another beauty like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were drifting down the little lough very slowly.
There were purple shadows under the hills, lying across
the strip of bog that stretched westward, where the
curlew and golden plover were calling. A little breeze
sprang up, just rippling the surface of the water.
Wally got out his rod hastily; but though the conditions
seemed ideal, the trout had apparently gone to
sleep, and when an hour’s casting had not yielded so
much as a rise, it was decided that there might be
better things than fishing, and the party returned to
the shore. A small boy, lurking about the landing
stage, was entrusted with the rods and baskets, and
disappeared slowly among the trees fringing the path
that led to the hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are we going to do?” Jim asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to Gortbeg,” Norah said. “I want
some pins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pins?” Jim echoed. “Why ever must you
walk two miles for pins? I’m sure you don’t use
one in a year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, and so I haven’t got any,” Norah said. “And
I must have some, because I want to shorten my
bog-lepping skirt, and I can’t turn up the edge without
pins to keep it in place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you sew that sort of thing, don’t you?” Jim
asked, wrestling with masculine obtuseness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course—after you’ve pinned it in place.
Jimmy, you had better let me attack that skirt in my
own way!” said Norah, justly incensed. “If you’d
tried climbing a mountain in a too-long skirt you
wouldn’t argue about making it shorter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess I would cut a foot off it without arguing
at all,” said Jim, laughing. “Skirts are fool-things
out of a house. Well, lead on, my child: I suppose
we’re all going pin-hunting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road to Gortbeg lay between high banks, with
occasional gaps through which could be seen pleasant
moors and fields, and sometimes an old mansion,
almost hidden by enormous beech-trees. Most of the
great houses of the country were silent and closely-shuttered;
the men of the family away fighting, the
women doing Red Cross work in London, or nursing
as near the firing-line as they could manage to establish
themselves. In a few were faint signs of occupation:
a white-haired old lady on a lawn, an old man, surrounded
by a number of dogs, of many breeds, wandering
through the woods; but even in these houses
there was an air of brooding quiet and expectancy,
of silent daily watching for news. The gardens were
gay with summer flowers, and nothing could spoil the
beauty of the trees; but there were weeds in the mould,
and the paths were unkempt and moss-grown. The
district was never a rich one, and now the war had
taken all its men and money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down the road, to meet them, came a boy on a
donkey: a cheery small boy, sitting very far back with
his knees well in. The donkey was guiltless of bridle
or saddle, obeying, with meekness, if not with alacrity,
suggestions conveyed to it by the pressure of the bare
knees and occasional blows with an ash cudgel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The asses of Ireland are a patient race,” remarked
Wally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They had need to be,” Jim answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s up to the ass to be patient in most places,”
remarked Mr. Linton. “Life isn’t exactly a picnic
to him anywhere. On the whole, the Irish donkeys
seem well enough cared for; I have seen their brothers
in other countries far worse treated. That’s a nice
donkey you have, sonny”—to the small rider, who
passed them, grinning cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is, sorr”; and the grin widened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re such jolly kids in these parts,” Wally
said. “They always greet you as if you were the one
person they had wanted to see for years; and they’re
so interested in you. It doesn’t seem like curiosity,
either, but real, genuine interest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is, as far as it goes,” Jim said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well it may not go far, but it’s comforting while
it lasts—and it generally lasts as long as one is there
oneself. It’s just as well it doesn’t go deeper, or
visitors would leave an awful trail of unrequited affection
behind them. As it is, one feels they recover
after one has gone, after doing all they can to make
one’s stay pleasant. Yes, I think Ireland’s a nice,
friendly country,” Wally finished. “And there’s
Gortbeg, looking as if it had forgotten to wake up for
about five hundred years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was not much of Gortbeg. A busy little
river flowed past it hurriedly, and the village had
sprung up along one bank: one winding street, with a
few cottages and a whitewashed inn which called
itself the Fisherman’s Arms. Some boats were moored
in the stream near the inn, where a crazy landing-stage
jutted out. Scarcely anyone was to be seen
except a few children, playing on the green, which
they shared with numerous geese, a few donkeys, and
some long-haired goats; while over the half-door of
one of the cabins a knot of shawled women gossiped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s your shop, Norah,” Mr. Linton said,
indicating a dingy building which bore in its window a
curious assortment of cheap sweets, slates, apples, red
flannel, and bacon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks a bit queer,” Norah commented, regarding
the emporium rather doubtfully. “However, it’s sure
to have pins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shop was prudently secured, by a bolted half-door,
against the ravages of predatory geese or goats.
Within, it was very dark, and prolonged hammering
on the counter failed to bring any response. Finally
Jim found his way into a back room and cooee’d lustily,
returning in some haste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phew-w! There’s a gentleman in corduroys, asleep
on a bed, and two dead pigs hanging by their heels,”
he said. “None of them took any notice of me; but
some one out at the back answered. Here he comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proprietor of the shop entered hurriedly: a
plump little man, very breathless and apologetic, and
more than a little damp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I left a bit of a young gossoon to mind the shop,”
he said—“and I washin’ meself. It’s gone he is,
playin’ with the other boys—sure I’ll teach him to
play when I get a holt of him. Pins, miss? Is it
hairpins, now, you’d be wanting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, just ordinary pins,” Norah told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m,” said the shopman, doubtfully. “I dunno
would I have them, at all. If it was hairpins, now,
there’s not a place in Donegal where you’d get a finer
selection. Pins .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He pondered deeply, and rummaged
in a box that seemed sacred to extremely
sticky bull’s eyes. “Well, well, we’d better look for
them. It might be they’d be in some odd corner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wall behind him was divided into innumerable
little compartments, and he looked faithfully through
them all, striking match after match to illumine his
progress. There were assorted goods in the compartments:
nails and screws, tin saucepan-lids, marbles,
boots, soap, oranges, reels of cotton, biscuits, socks,
and ass’s shoes; he searched them all, turning over
the contents of each until the match burned down to
his fingers, when he would throw it hastily on the
floor, strike another, and move on to the next collection.
The box of matches was nearly exhausted when
at length he gave up his quest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re not in it at all,” he said, despondently.
“I did have some, one time, but I expect they’re sold
on me. When the traveller comes I could be getting
some in from Belfast, if there was no hurry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah indicated that there was hurry, and asked
if there were another shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s Mary Doody’s,” said the man of business,
sadly; “at the least, you might call it a shop, though
it’s only herself knows what she sells. That’s the
only one.” He came to the doorway, and pointed
down the street. “The last house, it is. If ’twas
anything in the wurruld now, except pins, I’d have
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little way from the shop, he caught them up,
breathless, but aflame with business enterprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it from Moroney’s ye are? Would ye tell
Mrs. Moroney that I’ve the grandest bit of pork ever
she seen—killed yesterday, an’ they me own pigs that
I rared on the place. Peter Grogan—sure, she’ll
know me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” Jim said, hurriedly. “Good night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night,” responded Mr. Grogan. “Tell her
to-morrow’s early closing day, an’ I could bring one
over in the little ass-cart as aisy as not.” The last
words were uttered in a high shriek as the distance
widened between himself and the Linton party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pork is a good thing,” said Mr. Linton, sententiously.
“Isn’t it, Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’d seen the room I saw!” said his son, with
feeling. “Such a bedroom: and the gentleman in
bed, and I should say very drunk. No, I don’t think
I’ll deliver that message.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t,” said Mr. Linton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary Doody’s place of business stood back a little
from the road. There was no window for the display
of goods, and the door was shut. The uninitiated
might, indeed, have been pardoned for failing to regard
it as a shop, or for passing by, unnoticed, the brief
legend over the door which stated that Mrs. Doody’s
residence was a Generil Store, and added that she
was further empowered to sell stout and porter. The
inhabitants of Gortbeg, however, were clearly to be
numbered among the initiated, for sounds of conviviality
came, muffled, from within, and once a voice
broke into a snatch of a song. Norah hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I needn’t knock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They might not hear you, if you did,” Jim said.
He opened the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within, a long, low room was dim with a mixture of
turf and tobacco smoke, and heavy with the fumes of
porter. A swinging lamp shed a depressed ray over
the scene. As her eyes grew accustomed to the smoky
twilight, Norah made out a number of men and a few
women sitting on benches near the fire, each with a
mug that evidently held comforting liquor. Every
one seemed to be talking at once; but a dead silence
fell as the door opened on the unfamiliar figures.
Norah resisted an inclination to turn and seek fresh
air. An immensely fat woman, with a grimy shawl
pinned across her bosom, waddled forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening, dear,” she said, dividing the greeting
impartially between Jim and Norah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening,” Norah responded. “This is a
shop, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is, dear,” Mrs. Doody said, bridling a little at
any doubt being cast on her emporium. “Were you
wantin’——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pins,” Norah said hastily. “Do you keep
them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno would I,” said Mary Doody, unconsciously
echoing Mr. Grogan. “Pins. Would they
be small pins, now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—just common pins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pins,” said Mary Doody, reflecting deeply. She
turned and sought in unsavoury boxes which held a
stock as varied, if not so numerous, as that of Mr.
Grogan. The porter-drinkers became immensely interested.
Some of the women came nearer and stared
at the strangers, and one or two, catching Norah’s eye,
smiled a greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary Doody heaved her mighty form up from the
box over which she had been crouching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had some, wanst,” she said. “But ’tis gone
they are, or may be them gerrls has them taken.
Wouldn’t anything else do for you, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you,” Norah said, hastily. She turned
to go, pursued by Mrs. Doody, who suddenly became
interested in the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you try Peter Grogan?” she asked. “He
have a little shop up yonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah admitted having tried and failed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My, my!” said Mary Doody. “ ’Tis puttin’ a
bad direction on a counthry when you can’t buy a
paper of pins in it, isn’t it, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah laughed. “I’m sorry you haven’t got them,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. There’s no call for them here, dear. We
do be using buttons,” said Mary Doody, blandly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under cover of this broadside Norah made a confused
exit, to find Jim and Wally helpless with laughter
without.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never did I see anyone taught her place so beautifully!”
said Jim, ecstatically. “That will teach you
to be tidy, young Norah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buttons!” said Norah, laughing. “I’d like to see
Mary Doody shorten a skirt with the aid of buttons.
Anyhow, I’ve got to do it without the aid of pins,
that’s evident. Come home, you unsympathetic
frivollers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was two days later, that, coming in late and
ravenously hungry after a long tramp across the bog,
the Lintons made a hurried toilet and a still more
hurried descent to the dining-room. Dinner had been
kept waiting for them, and they applied themselves
to it with an energy born of a long day in the open air
and a sandwich lunch. It was when the first edge
of appetite had been taken off, and they were toying
with a mammoth apple-pie, that Mrs. Moroney bore
down upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid we were very late, Mrs. Moroney,” said
Mr. Linton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, ’tis no matter,” said the lady of the house,
waving away the suggestion. “In the heighth of the
season there’s many a one roaring for dinner, and it
ten o’clock at night. Did you enjoy your dinner,
now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We did, indeed,” said Mr. Linton; “it was most
excellent pork——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped, catching Jim’s eye, into which had
come a sudden light of comprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pork!” said Jim faintly. “Yes, it <span class='it'>was</span> pork.
Mrs. Moroney, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wonder .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t tell me there was anything wrong with it,”
said Mrs. Moroney, aflame in the defence of the pork.
“I never see better pigs than them ones of Peter
Grogan’s; and he after killing them only last Tuesday!”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>S</span>IR John O’Neill paid his formal call on the
Australians, tactfully choosing a day so hopelessly
wet as to forbid any thought of fishing or “bog-lepping.”
Bog excursions had a peculiar fascination
for Norah and the boys, who loved rambling among
the deep brown pools, leaping from tuft to tuft of
sound grass, and making experiments—frequently
disastrous—in mossy surfaces that looked sound,
but were very likely to prove quagmires which effectually
removed any lurking doubt in Norah’s mind
that an Irish bog could be boggy. They sought the
bogs in almost all weathers. But the day that brought
Sir John to the old house on Lough Aniller was one of
such pitiless rain that prudence, in the shape of Mr.
Linton, forbade any excursion to patients so newly
recovered as Jim and Wally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even in the most homelike of boarding-houses a
wet day is apt to be depressing to open-air people.
It was with relief, mingled with amazement, that
they saw the motor coming up the dripping avenue
in the afternoon; and a moment later Bridget, obviously
impressed, ushered Sir John into the drawing-room.
The Lintons were established as favourites
in the household on their own merits; but it was
placing them on quite a different standard of respect
to find that they were visited by the “ould
stock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every one enjoyed the visit. Sir John was better,
the lines of pain that Wally had seen nearly gone from
his face. There was an almost boyish eagerness
about him; he was keen to know them all, to hear
their frank talk, to make friends with them. David
Linton and his son liked him from the moment they
met his eyes; brown eyes, with something of the
mute appeal that lies in the eyes of a dog. As for
Norah, in all her life she had not known what it meant
to be so sorry for anyone as she felt for this brave,
crippled man, with his high-bred face and gallant bearing.
Afterwards, when John O’Neill looked back at
heir meeting, one of his memories of Norah was that
she had never seemed to see his misshapen shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That first visit had stretched over the whole afternoon,
no one quite knew how. Outside, the rain
streamed down the window-panes and lashed the
lough into waves; but within the old house a fire of
turf and bog-wood blazed, casting ruddy lights on the
furniture, and sending its pleasant, acrid smell into the
room. They gathered round it in a half-circle and
“yarned”—exchanging stories of Ireland, and Australia,
and London and war. There could be no talk
in those grim days without war-stories and war-rumours;
but after a time they drifted away to far-off
times, and Sir John, beginning half-timidly with an
old Irish legend, found that he had a suddenly enthralled
circle of listeners, who demanded more, and
yet more—tales of high and far-off times and of the
mighty heroes of Ireland: Finn MacCool and the
Fianna, Cuchulain, Angus Og, and the half-real, half-legendary
past that holds Ireland in a mist of romance.
He knew it all, and loved it, telling the stories with
the quiet pride of a descendant of a race whose roots
were deep in the soil of the land that had borne them:
and the children of the country that had no history
hung upon his words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What must you think of me?” he said at last,
when, in a pause, the clock in the hall boomed out six
strokes. “I come to call, and I remain to an unseemly
hour spinning yarns. The fact is, you—well,
you just aren’t strangers at all, and I certainly knew
you before. Were you in Ireland in a previous incarnation,
Miss Norah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would love to think so,” she said. “One would
like to have had some part in the Ireland you can talk
about. Will you come again and tell us more, Sir
John?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes were grateful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I don’t bore you. I fastened upon this poor
boy”—indicating Wally with a friendly nod—“the
other day when I was desperately sick of my own
company, and now I seem to have done the same to
you all; and you’re very good to a lonely man. But
I want all of you at Rathcullen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re coming,” said Wally, solemnly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you? I timed my call to-day, because I
didn’t think even half-amphibious Australians would
be out in such weather—and see what luck I’ve had!”
He looked no older than the boys, his eager face glowing
in the firelight. “But please don’t come to Rathcullen
formally, Mr. Linton; if I bring the car over can I
carry you all off to-morrow for lunch? There are
horses simply spoiling to be ridden, Miss Norah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh-h!” said Norah. “But I’ve no riding-things
with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That doesn’t matter: I have two young cousins
who occasionally pay me a visit, and their riding-kit
is at Rathcullen, since they can’t use it in London.
I’m sure you can manage with it; details of fit don’t
signify much in Donegal.” He rose, and stood on the
hearthrug looking eagerly at them. When he was
sitting, his finely-modelled head and clever face made
it easy to forget his dwarfed body: standing, among
the lithe, tall Australians, it was suddenly pitifully
evident. He felt it, for he flushed, and for a moment
his eyes dropped; then he faced them again, bravely.
Mr. Linton spoke, hurriedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We would be delighted to go to you. But are
we not rather a numerous party? I think we ought
to send a detachment!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed—I wouldn’t know which to choose!”
returned the Irishman, whimsically. “You see, you
are just a godsend to me, if you will spare me a little
of your time; I have been so long shut up alone.
And it’s not good to be alone when one is spoiling to
be in the thick of things; I grow horribly bad-tempered.
When I know that these young giants are out
of the hunt, too, I become more reconciled to circumstances.
You see my complete selfishness!” He
smiled at them delightfully. “So, may I come for
you all to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks—but there is really no reason why we
should trouble you to bring the motor. We can easily
walk over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s every reason; I’ll get you earlier!” said
O’Neill, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The motor slid down the avenue in the driving rain,
and the Australians looked at each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever make friends so quickly with anyone,
dad?” Jim asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think I did,” David Linton answered.
“There’s something about him one can’t quite express:
so much of the child left in the man. Poor
fellow—poor fellow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think he’s the bravest man I ever saw,” said
Norah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day at Rathcullen House was the first of many.
Sir John was so frankly eager to have them there, and
his welcome was so spontaneous and heart-felt, that
the Australians suddenly felt themselves “belong,”
and the beautiful old house became to them an Irish
version of their own Billabong. Ireland, always
many-sided, showed them a new and fascinating face.
They had loved the lanes and bogs and moors where
they had been free to wander. But now they found
themselves free of a wide demesne where wealth and
art had done all that was possible to aid Nature, with
a perfect understanding of where it was best to leave
Nature alone. The park, with its splendid old trees,
and the well-kept fields around it, gave opportunities
for trying Sir John’s horses; and Norah and the boys
were soon under the spell of jumping the big banks
that the hunters took so cleverly,—although, at first,
to see them jump on to a bank, change feet with lightning
rapidity, and leap down the far side, seemed to
Antipodean eyes more like a circus performance than
ordinary riding! Beyond the park stretched miles
of deer-forest, unlike an ordinary forest in that it had
no trees,—being a great expanse of heathery hills and
moor, seamed and studded with rocks, streams babbling
here and there, half-hidden in deep channels fringed
with long grass and heather and ling. As land, it
Was worthless; nothing would grow in the stony
barren soil save the moorland plants; but it formed
a glorious ground for long rambles. O’Neill was
fast recovering his normal strength, and his energy
was always like a devouring fire; he could not, however,
walk far, and he and David Linton would find rocky
seats on the moor while Norah and the boys rambled
far over the deer-forest, often stalking patiently for
an hour, armed with field-glasses, to catch a glimpse
of the shy red-deer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A don’t know why people want to shoot them,”
Norah said, after a long crawl through the rough
heather, which had resulted in a splendid view of a
magnificent stag. “They’re so beautiful; and it’s
just as much fun to stalk them like this!” To which
Jim and Wally returned non-committal grunts, and
exchanged, privately, glances of amazement at the
strangeness of the feminine outlook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes there were days on the lough at the
far end of the Rathcullen bog: a well-stocked lough
where no outside fishing was permitted, and which
yielded them trout of a weight far beyond their dreams;
and there were motor-drives far afield, exploring the
country-side, with Sir John always ready with legends
and stories of the “ould ancient” times. Even on
wet days the big Rolls-Royce would appear early in the
morning, bearing an urgent invitation; and wet days
were easy to spend in Rathcullen—in the great hall,
the well-stocked library, the conservatories, or the
picture-gallery, where faces of long-dead O’Neills,
some of them startlingly like their host, stared down
at them from the panelled walls. In the billiard-room
Wally and Jim fought cheerful battles, while Mr.
Linton would write Australian letters in the library,
and Norah and Sir John explore other nooks and
corners of the great house, or discourse music after
their own fashion. His friendship seemed fitted to
each: with Mr. Linton he could be the man of affairs,
deeply-read and thoughtful; while to the boys and
Norah he was the most delightful of chums, as full of
fun even as Wally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He fits in so,” said Jim. “He’s never in our
way, and—what is a good deal more wonderful—I
don’t believe we’re ever in his!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many times Sir John begged them to transfer themselves
altogether to Rathcullen. But something of
Australian independence held them back; they preferred
to retain their rooms at the Lough Aniller house,
though it saw less and less of them in the daytime, and
Timsy openly bewailed their constant absence—until
the sergeant came home on furlough, when Timsy
promptly forgot every one else in the world, and
walked with his head in clouds of glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed,” Mr. Linton said, one day, in answer to a
renewed invitation—“I am frequently ashamed to
think how completely we seem to have quartered ourselves
on you, O’Neill. It’s hardly fair to inflict you
still further.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you could but guess what you have done for me,
you might be surprised,” Sir John answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were in the motor, running along a smooth
high road near the little narrow-gauge railway line.
Ahead, Norah and the boys could be seen across a field,
riding; they had come across country, taking banks
and ditches as they came, and were making towards
a point where they were all to meet. John O’Neill
looked at the racing trio with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was in a pretty bad way when Wally dropped
on me in the boreen that morning,” he said, presently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said you were suffering terribly,” David Linton
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—that was nothing. I’m fairly well used to
pain when my stupid attacks come on, though that
had certainly been a stiff one. But—well, I think I
was beginning to lose heart. My physical disadvantages
have always been in my way, naturally; but I
have managed to keep them in the background to a
certain extent and live a man’s life, even in a second-rate
fashion. But since the war began I couldn’t do
it. I was so useless—a cumberer of the ground, when
every man was needed. My people have always
been fighters, until——until I came, to blot the record.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have no right to say that,” said David Linton,
sharply. “You did more than thousands of men are
doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did what I could. But I wanted to fight, man—to
fight! If you knew how I envied every private I
saw marching through London! every lucky youngster
with a sound heart and a pair of straight shoulders. I
had always set my teeth, before, and got through a
man’s work, somehow or other. But here was something
I couldn’t do—they wouldn’t have me. And even
over what work I was able to tackle, I went to pieces.
When I came back to Ireland I felt like rubbish, flung
out of the way—out of the way of men who were men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not fair to feel like that,” David Linton said.
“And it is not true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—you have all helped me to believe that perhaps
I am not altogether on the dust-heap. You came
when I was desperate; every day in Rathcullen was
making me worse. I couldn’t go into the picture-gallery;
the fighting-men on the walls seemed to look
at me in scorn to see to what a poor thing the old
house had come down. And then you all came, and
you didn’t seem to notice that anything was wrong
with me. You made me one of you—even those youngsters,
full of all the energy and laughter and youth of
that big young country of yours. They have made a
chum of me: I haven’t laughed for years as I’ve
laughed in the last fortnight. And I’m fitter than
I’ve been for years—I’ve forgotten to think of myself,
and when you all go I also am going back, to work.
There must be work, even for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For you! Why, you’re a young man, full of
energy, even if you can’t have active service,” said
David Linton. “And I am a grey old man, but
there’s work for me. Don’t think that you have no
job, because you can’t get the job you like; that’s an
easy attitude to adopt. Every man can find his job
if he looks for it with his eyes open.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you have helped mine to open,” O’Neill said.
“I was miserable because I had hitched my wagon
to a star and had found I couldn’t drive it. The old
servants—bless their kind hearts!—were purring over
me and pitying me, and I was feeling raw; and then
you all walked into my life and declined to notice that
I was a useless dwarf——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you aren’t,” said the other man, sharply.
“Don’t talk utter nonsense!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Neill laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—I won’t forget,” he said. “But I am
grateful; only I sometimes wonder if I ask for too
much of your time. Do you think the youngsters are
bored?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bored!” Mr. Linton said in amazement. “Why,
they are having the time of their lives! I could not
possibly have given them half the pleasure you have
Put in their way. You talk of gratitude, but to my
mind it should be entirely on our side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said O’Neill firmly. “Still, I’m glad to
think they are enjoying themselves,—not merely being
polite and benevolent!” Whereat David Linton
broke into laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust they’d be polite in any circumstances,”
he said. “But even politeness has its limits. You
wouldn’t call that sort of thing forced, would you?
Look.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pointed across a field. Norah and the boys
were galloping to meet them. They flashed up a little
hill, dipped down into a hollow, and scurried up another
rise, where a stiff bank met them, with a deep
drop into the next field. Norah’s brown pony got
over it with the cleverness of a cat, and she raced
ahead of the boys, who set sail after her, vociferating
quite unintelligible remarks about people who took
unfair short cuts. Their merry voices brought echoes
from the hills. Norah maintained her advantage until
a low bank brought them out into the road, and all
together they trotted towards the waiting motor.
Their glowing faces sufficiently answered Sir John’s
doubts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course you beat them, Norah—easily!”
he said, shamelessly ignoring the boys’ side of the race.
“Didn’t I tell you that pony could beat most things
in Donegal, if she got the chance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did cut a corner,” Norah admitted, laughing.
“But ’tis themselves has the animals of great size—and
they flippant leppers!” She dropped into brogue
with an ease born of close association with Timsy and
his parents. “Sir John, is that the Doon Rock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pointed with her whip to a great rocky eminence
half a mile away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s the Rock,” O’Neill answered. “It’s
rather a landmark, isn’t it? We’ll wait for you at
the foot, if you’ll jog on after us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The riders followed the motor slowly. The road led
past the great mass, half hill, half rock, that towered
over the little fields. It was about three hundred
feet high, with sparse vegetation endeavouring to find
a footing on its rugged sides, and grey boulders,
weather-worn and clothed with lichen, jutting out, grim
and bleak. The motor halted under its shadow, and
the groom who occupied the front seat with Con, the
lame chauffeur, led the horses away to a cottage close
by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few hundred yards away a curious sight puzzled
the Australians. On a little green, where some grey
stones marked a well, was a little plantation of sticks
stuck in the ground. Fluttering rags waved from
many of them, and ornamented the ragged brambles
near the well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t seen a holy well, have you?” O’Neill
asked. “That is one of the most famous—the Well
of Doon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what are the sticks?” Wally asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come and see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked over to the well. A deeply marked
path led to it, and all about it the ground was beaten
hard by the feet of many people, save in the patch of
ground where the sticks stood upright. There were
all kinds of sticks; rough stakes, cut from a hedge,
ash-plants, blackthorns—some of no value, others
well-finished and costly. Rags, white and coloured,
fluttered from them. And there was more than one
crutch, standing straight and stiff among the lesser
sticks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what is it?” breathed Norah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a holy well. Hundreds of years ago there
was a great sickness in the country, and the people
sent to a saint who had originally come from these
parts, begging him to come and help them. The saint
was in Rome, and he could not come. But he was
sorry for the people; and the legend goes that he
threw his staff into a well in Rome, and it sank, and
emerged from the water of the Well of Doon here:
and ever since then the people believe that the water
has healing power, and that it will heal anyone who
pilgrimages to it barefoot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But does it?” asked Wally, incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—they say the age of miracles is past. But
the age of faith-healing is not; and you won’t find
an Irishman, whatever his religion, sneering at the
old holy places of Ireland. I don’t pretend to understand
these things, but I respect them. And then—there
is no doubt whatever as to the genuineness, and
the permanence, of many of the cures.” He pointed
to the little forest of sticks. “Look at those sticks: each
one left here by a grateful man or woman who came
leaning on the stick, and went away not needing it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Scott!” said Wally. “And the rags?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are votive offerings. If you look on that
flat stone near the well you’ll find hundreds of others—tokens,
medals, little ornaments, even hairpins: all
valueless, but left by people too poor to give even a
penny. They believe the saint understands: and I
think he would be a hard saint if he did not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stone was almost covered with tiny offerings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does no one touch them?” Jim asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re sacred. If you left money there it would
not be touched.” He pointed to a handful of wilting
daisies. “I expect those were left by children on their
way to school. All the poor know that it is the spirit,
not the letter, of an offering that counts: and even
those daisies are left in perfect faith that the saint
will see to the matter if trouble should come to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never thought such beliefs still existed,” said
Mr. Linton, greatly interested. “Look at this crutch—it’s
quite good, and looks newly-planted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A woman, barefooted and with a shawl over her
head, had come across the grass from the cottage. She
curtseyed to O’Neill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was left this morning, sir,” she said, indicating
the crutch. “Sure, the man that owned it was in a
bad way: he come from Dublin, an’ he crippled in
his hip. On a side-car they brought him, and there
was two men to lift him on and off it, and he yellow
with the dint of the pain he had. I seen him limping
on his crutch across to the well. And when he went
away he walked over to the car as aisy as you or me,
and not a limp on him at all, and him throwing a leg
on to the car like a boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean to say he went away cured?” exclaimed
Mr. Linton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, there’s his crutch,” said the woman, simply.
“He’d no more use at all for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well-l!” The Australians looked blankly at each
other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis fourteen years I’ve been living over beyant,”
said the woman. “I’ve seen them come on sticks
and on crutches; some of them carried, and some of
them put on cars: but they all walked away—all that
had faith in the saint. Why wouldn’t they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a brief question that somehow left them without
any answer, since simple faith is too big a thing
to meddle with. They said good-bye to the woman
and went back to the Rock, where the groom was
waiting to help his master in the climb—an old groom
with a face like a withered rosy apple. The ascent was
not difficult: a winding path led to the summit of
the Rock, and they were soon at the top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Between them, Elizabeth and Cromwell didn’t
leave us many of our old monuments,” said O’Neill,
looking away across the country. “But thank goodness
they couldn’t touch the Doon Rock!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The summit was almost flat; a long narrow plateau
with soft grass growing in its hollows. One end was
wider than the other, with a kind of saddle connecting
the two: and in the middle of the smaller end was a
great flat stone that looked almost like an altar. All
about the high, precipitous eminence the country lay
like an unrolled map far beneath them: a wide expanse
of flat moor and field and fallow, in the midst
of which the great Rock showed, almost startling in
its rugged steepness. Little villages were dotted here
and there, and sometimes could be seen the blue gleam
of water. The white smoke of a train made a creeping
line against the dark bog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Con and the groom had placed the luncheon-basket
in a grassy hollow where there was shelter from the
breeze that swept keenly across the high Rock; and
had retreated with the instinctive delicacy of the Irish
peasant, who never intrudes upon “the genthry”
when eating, and himself prefers to eat alone. After
lunch, Norah and Wally collected the débris of the
feast and burned it under the lee side of a boulder,
in the belief that no decent person leaves such things
as picnic-papers for the next comer to see: and then
they strolled across the narrow saddle to the stone
on the farther side, where the others had already
wandered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us about it, Sir John, please,” Norah begged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was here that the old O’Donnell chiefs were
inaugurated,” O’Neill said. “They were the rulers
of Tyrconnell, which is now north-west Ulster: the
old name is still used in a good deal of Irish poetry.
All the clan used to gather when a new leader was to
be installed, the people clustering down in the plain
below, and the chieftain and his principal men up here
on the Rock. It must have been worth seeing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim drew a long breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should just think so,” he said, “Tell us more,
O’Neill: I want to reconstruct it. This old Rock must
have looked just the same as it does to-day. It’s
something to have seen even that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just the same,” said Sir John, his eyes kindling
at the boy’s enthusiasm. “The Inauguration Stone
may have been in better preservation, but a few dozen
centuries can’t do much to the Rock. Well—you can
picture the people down below, thousands of them.
All the country would be a great unfenced plain—no
banks and hedges such as you see to-day, and very
likely no roads worth calling roads. There would be
forests, most probably, and, in them, animals that
became extinct long ago, like the wild boar and wolf.
The ground below would be a great camp—every one
making merry and dressed in their best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think that even in those days it wouldn’t
take much to make an Irish crowd merry,” Wally said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They would have plenty of entertainment: jugglers,
fortune-tellers, buffoons in painted masks, and
champions, showing feats with weapons and strength—probably
‘spoiling for a fight.’ Music there would
be in abundance: pipes, tube-players, harps, and
bands of chorus-singers. There would be any amount
of fun in the crowd. But, of course, the Rock would
be the centre of everyone’s thoughts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all coming quite distinctly,” said Norah, who
was sitting on the grass, gazing out over the plain.
“If you look hard you can see them all, in saffron
kilts and flowing cloaks like you told us, Sir John.
Now tell us who is up here on the Rock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The new chief is where Wally is, sitting on the
great stone,” said O’Neill, smiling at her. “Do you
want to know what he’s wearing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, please!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you can picture him a goodly man, to begin
with, for no chief could reign unless he were a champion,
free from the slightest physical defect. ‘He was
graceful and beautiful of form, without blemish or
reproach,’ one old chronicle says. ‘Fair yellow hair
he had, and it bound with a golden band to keep it
from loosening. A red buckler upon him, with stars
and animals of gold thereon, and fastenings of silver.
A crimson cloak in wide descending folds around him,
fastened at his neck with precious stones. A torque
of gold round his neck’—that’s a broad twisted band:
you can see them to-day in the Museum in Dublin.
‘A white shirt with a full collar upon him, intertwined
with red gold thread. A girdle of gold, inlaid with
precious stones, around him. Two wonderful shoes
of gold, with golden loops, about the feet. Two
spears with golden sockets in his hands, with rivets
of red bronze.’ There—can you see him, Norah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m trying, but he dazzles me!” Norah said.
“Go on, please. Who else is there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All his nobles and councillors, dressed almost as
splendidly as the chief himself. The old books are
full of details of the richness of their apparel: gold
and silver and fine clothing must have been an ordinary
thing with them—and not only was it so, but the
workmanship was exquisite. They had ‘shirts ribbed
with gold thread, crimson fringed cloaks, embroidered
coats of rejoicing, clothing of red silk, and shirts of the
dearest silk.’ They wore helmets, and carried spears,
’sharp, thin, hard-pointed, with rivets of gold and
silk thongs for throwing’; ‘long swords, with hilts
and guards of gold; and shields of silver, with rim
and boss of gold.’ One man is described as ‘having
in his hand a small-headed, white-breasted hound,
with a collar of rubbed gold and a chain of old silver’:
and a horse had a bridle of silver rings and a gold bit.
They had shoes of white bronze, and great golden
brooches, with ‘gold chains about their necks and
bands of gold above them again.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Neill stopped and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could go on for a long time,” he said. “But
I’m afraid it begins to sound like the description of
Solomon’s Temple!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And to think,” said Jim, unheeding him, “that we
had a vague idea that Ireland had been inhabited only
by savages!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Schools don’t teach you anything about Ireland,”
said O’Neill, contemptuously. “A few hours among
the exquisite old things in the Dublin Museum would
open your eyes: the finest goldsmiths and silversmiths
of the present world cannot touch the beauty of the
workmanship of the treasures there;—and some of
them were dug up out of bogs, after lying there no
one knows how many hundred or thousand years.
They were craftsmen in those days, and they loved
the work. You don’t get that spirit in Trades Union
times!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t talk about Trades Unions!” Norah cried.
“We’re on the Doon Rock, and I can see all those
people round the chief, and the crowd on the plain
below, looking up. What else, Sir John?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There would be white-robed Druids,” O’Neill
said; “and the King’s bards or poets would be about
him. The bard was a very important person and a
high functionary, with wide powers. In a sense he
was the war-correspondent of his day: he never
fought, but he was always present at a battle, and very
much in it, noting the heroic deeds of the warriors,
and afterwards recording them in his songs. Poetry
in those days was a most business-like and practical
thing, for everything of any importance was written
in verse, such as the laws, the genealogies of the clans,
and their history. The poet held an exalted position,
and was educated for it from his boyhood by a course
of careful study: and the chief poet ranked next to
the king, and went about with almost as fine a retinue.
They were the professors of their day, and kept schools
for training lads for their order. A man had to be
very careful not to offend one, or he would write a
satire against the culprit; and these satires were
dreaded extremely, since they were believed to cause
disaster and desolation to fall not only on a man but
on his whole family. Nowadays, editors are said
to keep special wastepaper baskets for dealing with
poets, but it wouldn’t have done in the ould ancient
times—the post of an editor would have been too
unhealthy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it is through them that the old stories
have come down,” Jim said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. They had to write the verse-tales, and
they had to tell them, too; they were obliged to learn
and teach three hundred and fifty kinds of versification,
and an Ollave, or chief poet, could recite at any moment
any of three hundred and fifty stories. They did a lot
of harm, because they abused their power; and at
last, in the sixth century, were nearly banished from
Ireland altogether. Columcille saved them from that
fate, but they were made much less important. However,
the poets that you are looking at with your
mind’s eye, Norah, were ages before that, and you can
imagine them as gorgeous and as haughty as possible,
and every one is very polite to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to get off this stone and make room for
the chief,” said Wally, solemnly, rising. “There’s
the ghost of a poet, glaring at me, and he’s going to
burst into a satire.” He subsided on the grass beside
Norah. “Go on, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that is the crowd on top of the Rock,” Sir
John said: “nobles, councillors, poets, and Druids,
all in order of rank: the Rock would hold three or
four hundred, all told. And the crowd below, gazing
up. I’m glad you got off the stone, Wally, because
the chief wants it now. He takes off his wonderful
shoes of gold, and places one foot on the stone, and
swears to preserve all ancient customs inviolable,
to deliver up the rulership peaceably, when the time
comes, to his successor, to rule the people with justice,
and to maintain the laws. Then he puts away his
weapons, and the highest of his nobles, an hereditary
official, gives him a straight white rod in token of
authority—straight, to remind him that his administration
should be just, and white, that his actions
should be pure and upright. Then he gives him new
sandals: and keeping one of the golden shoes, he
throws the other over the new chief’s head and proclaims
him O’Donnell. All the nobles repeat the
title—can’t you hear the mighty shout, and the crowd
below taking it up, so that it rings over Tyrconnell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh-h!” breathed Norah. “And it was here,
where we are sitting!” She put her hand on the
ground that had felt the tramp of the hosts of ancient
days. “Was that all, Sir John?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That ended the ceremony; except that each
subject paid a cow as rod-money, a sort of tribute to
the new chief. But of course there was high feasting
and festival, probably for days. They had splendid
feasts, too. Once, when one of the great nobles entertained
the chief and all the men of Tyrconnel, the
preparations took a whole year. A special house was
built, surpassing all other buildings in beauty of
architecture, with splendid pillars and carvings: in
the banqueting-hall the wainscotting was of bronze
thirty feet high, overlaid with gold. It took a wagon-team
to carry each beam, and the strength of seven
men to fix each pole; and the royal couch was set
with precious stones ‘radiant with every hue, making
night bright as day.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Neill broke off, and hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I tell you too much?” he asked. “I’m afraid
my tongue runs away with me—but I did want you
to realize something of what Ireland was. There
were great men in those days, and the fighting-men
had high ideals of what great champions should be.
It is what kept us all through our lifetime,’ one said—‘truth
that was in our hearts, and strength in our
arms, and fulfilment on our tongues.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was silent, looking away. The proud soul, pent
in the misshapen body, found comfort in turning from
the present, that held so little for him, back to the
mighty past when the O’Neills, too, had been chieftains
and champions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he stood up, with a shrug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Time we went down, I’m afraid,” he said, cheerfully.
“Before we go, Norah, I will proceed to relate
for your benefit the six womanly gifts which were
demanded of properly-brought-up young women in
the high and far-off times in Ireland. They were,
the gift of modest behaviour, the gift of singing, the
gift of sweet speech, the gift of beauty, the gift of
wisdom, and the gift of needlework!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wow!” said poor Norah, in dismay. “Perhaps
it’s as well I got born in Australia!”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>‟I</span>S Mr. Linton in, Timsy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is, sir. Leastways, he’s out, down by
the lough, and all of them with him.” The small boy
looked up at Sir John O’Neill with more awe than he
was wont to regard most people. “Will I get him
for you, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—I’ll go down, myself. Is your father well,
Timsy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He does be splendid, sir,” said Timsy, his eye
brightening. “Only they’ll be takin’ him back soon,
to fight them ould Germans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect Lord Kitchener can’t do without him,”
said Sir John, confidentially. “Never mind,—we’ll
have him back in Donegal altogether, before long,
please goodness. And whisper, Timsy—when he
comes back for good, he’ll have a splendid medal on
his coat!” He patted the small boy on the head and
left him speechless before a prospect so tremendous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Linton party was discovered by the well on
the lough shore, where Wally was scratching the nose
of the patient donkey and talking to him, as Norah
said, as man to man. He had his back to the path
down from the garden, and did not hear Sir John’s
approach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’d come back to Australia with us, acushla
machree,” he said, “I’d guarantee you the best of
grass and you wouldn’t have any water to draw at,
all.” The ass drooped his head lower, and appeared,
not at all impressed by this dazzling future. “And
Murty would love you, and Norah would ride you after
cattle.” (“I would <span class='it'>not</span>!” from Norah.) “And
you could tell the horses about Ireland, and we’d tie
green ribbons round your neck on St. Patrick’s Day,
and let you wave a green flag with a harp on it in your
pearl-pale hand. Oh, lovely ass——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you speaking to me?” asked Sir John,
politely, near his ear; and Wally jumped, and joined
in the laugh against himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re twin-souls, this patient person and myself,”
he explained. “I’ve found it out, and I’m trying to
make the ass see it. Never mind, old chap; we’ll
continue this profitable conversation when we are
alone; unfeeling listeners only make you bashful.”
He produced a carrot from his pocket, and the ass ate
it, despondently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m awfully sorry to have interrupted your heart-to-heart
talk; but the fact is, Mr. Linton, I’m simply
bursting with an idea, and I had to hurry over and put
it before you.” Sir John spoke eagerly, turning to
Norah with a laugh. “Is it a good moment to approach
him, Norah? I want him to promise to do
something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He ate a noble breakfast,” said Norah, gravely.
“And he’s nearly finished his pipe. I should think
the moment’s favourable. Anyway, it will have to be
now, because I simply can’t wait to hear what it is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, we know your ideas, O’Neill,” Mr. Linton
said, laughing. “They generally combine a great
deal of trouble for yourself with something quite new
in the way of entertainment for us. This must be
particularly outrageous, as you want me to promise
beforehand. I think you had better make a clean
breast of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s this,” Sir John answered. “The weather
is glorious, and the glass is high; it’s useless weather
for fishing, and I think you have explored this neighbourhood
pretty thoroughly. The motor holds six
quite easily. What do you say to a trip north—a
little tour, to last about a week?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Subdued gasps came from Norah, Jim, and Wally.
Mr. Linton laughed outright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did I tell you?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” responded Sir John. “I think”—unblushingly—“that
Con needs a change; and it
would be an excellent way to give him one, if you
would only be kind enough to help me. You surely
wouldn’t refuse poor Con such a little thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve re-cast a good many of my ideas about Ireland,”
David Linton said. “But to utilize five people
to take one chauffeur for a change is certainly what I
was brought up to call an Irish way of doing things!
Seriously, however, O’Neill, your proposal is a very
tempting one. Shall we put it to the committee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The committee says, ‘Carried <span class='it'>nem. con.</span>’ I should
say,” said Jim. “It would be simply top-hole. But
isn’t it putting rather a strain on you and the motor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not—as far as I am concerned, a run in
sea-air is all I need to make me quite fit again,” O’Neill
answered. “What do you say about it, Norah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m speechless; and as for Wally, he’s leaning
up against the ass for support,” said Norah, indicating
Mr. Meadows, who grasped the hapless donkey fondly.
“It’s the most glorious plan, Sir John; and it’s just
like you, to think of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Neill’s delicate face flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re all such satisfactory people, because you’re
never bored,” he said. “And then, you like Ireland,
which makes everything delightful. Well, I thought
we might have a look at Horn Head and Sheep Haven,
Mr. Linton, and perhaps get across to The Rosses; or
would you rather have no fixed plan, but just wander
about, seeking what we may find? There are innumerable
little bays and inlets up there, all rather
fascinating; we should be between mountain and sea
scenery, and the inns here and there are fairly good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we will leave it entirely to you, so far as
planning the route goes,” Mr. Linton answered. “You
know the country, and we don’t; and as for us, any
part of Ireland is good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I vote for having no fixed plan at all,” Jim said.
“It’s when you have no plans that the best things
happen to you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll leave it at that, then,” said Sir John. “Can
we start to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have only two weeks more leave,” said Jim.
“So the sooner we go the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you can be ready, Norah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me? Oh, certainly,” said Norah, who, Wally
declared, was always ready at any time for anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, I’ll be off,” Sir John declared. “I left
Con hard at work on the car, giving her a thorough
overhaul—we could not believe that you would be so
hard-hearted as to refuse him the trip! But I have
a good many things to see to, and I’ll have a busy
day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could I help you?” Jim asked. “I’m handy
at odd jobs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you care to? I’ll be awfully glad of your
company,” said Sir John warmly. They went off
together, the boy’s great shoulders towering above
O’Neill’s dwarfed form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim did not return until late that night. Norah,
just about to blow out her candle, heard his light step
on the stair and called to him softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not asleep yet, kiddie?” Jim said, sitting down
on the bed. “You should be; you’ll be tired to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m all right,” said Norah, disregarding this
friendly caution. “Jim, I packed your bag; and
there’s a list of things just inside it, in case I made
any mistakes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you are a brick!” said Jim, who was accustomed
to stern independence, but, like most people,
greatly appreciated a little spoiling now and then.
“I was looking forward rather dismally to a midnight
packing; O’Neill wants to get off quite early in the
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We guessed that was likely. Did you have a good
day, Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite. I don’t think I was any particular help
to O’Neill; he found a few jobs for me, but I fancy
he had to rack his brains for them. But we pottered
about together all day, and had a very jolly time;
he’s such fun when he’s in good form, and he was like
a kid to-day. Made me laugh no end.” Jim pondered,
beginning to unlace his boots. “I think it’s
only when he is alone that those bitter fits get hold of
him; and he just dreads being alone. That’s why
he took me over, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought so,” nodded Norah. “But I do think
he’s happier than he was, Jim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe he is. Well, we’ll try to keep him laughing
for the next week or so, anyhow,” said Jim.
“Now, you go to sleep, old kiddie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fine weather held, making it easy to leave trout
which would have nothing to do with them; and next
day the motor took them away into bypaths of
Ireland, with new beauty and new legend at every
turn. They passed Gartan, and saw the birthplace
of Saint Columba, a tiny stone cell with a curiously
indented stone; and Columba’s ruined church of grey
stone, roofless, and with almost-effaced carvings on
its walls. Near it a tall, narrow stone stood crookedly—all
that remained of a cross. The ground before it,
hard as iron, was hollowed where the knees of thousands
of pilgrims had knelt in prayer, and the stone
itself was smooth from kisses that had been pressed
upon it through century after century. Sir John
knew many legends of the hot-tempered, fighting
saint, whose warlike proclivities eventually led to his
banishment from the Ireland he loved, to work and
suffer home-sickness until Death came at last to release
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The emigrants pray to him specially, since he,
too, knew what it meant to be lonely for Ireland,” Sir
John said. “He was a worker: he wrote three hundred
books and founded the same number of churches.
So he came to be called Columcille—<span class='it'>cille</span> meaning
church. An O’Donnell he was: one of the old house.
He made a famous copy of the Psalms, the disputed
ownership of which caused the fight that led to his
leaving Ireland: and this copy—it was called The
Cathach, or Battler—was an heirloom in the O’Donnell
family, who always carried it with them into battle,
in a shrine. One hates to think of him, exiled, working,
and longing for home. The first monastery he
founded was near Derry; he was only a young man
then, but long afterwards he wrote that the angels
of God sang in every glade of Derry’s oaks. I always
think one can see him in this queer little church—big
and powerful, with the fighting face and toilworn
hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a time they kept near the railway that creeps
through the heart of Donegal: a quaint, narrow-gauge
line where the trains saunter, forgetful of time. Its
way runs through deep bogs, which made its construction
no light matter, since solid foundation was
in some places only found eighty feet below the surface,
and great causeways, embankments, and viaducts
had to be built to carry it. Sometimes, in contrast,
the way had to be hewn through solid rock. On one
hand lay wild and rugged mountains, with some fine
dominating peaks: Muckish—“the hog’s back”—with
its long, flattened ridge, changing from every
angle of vision; and the great peak of Errigal, bare
and glistening, the highest mountain in Donegal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a great old peak,” said Sir John, looking at
it affectionately. “You can see Scotland from the
top—and all over Donegal, and southward to the
Sligo and Galway hills.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How it glistens!” said Norah, watching the great
cone as the motor went slowly along. “What makes
it so white?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s white quartz; it gives it its name, ‘the
silver mountain.’ It looks a single peak from here,
but as we round it you’ll see that there are really two
heads close together; there is a narrow ridge, with a
track about a foot wide, connecting them. Some
day, when you all come back to stay with me at Rathcullen,
we must arrange an expedition for you to
climb it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their wandering way led them from the railway
line, after a time; and they struck northward into
lonely country of moors and bogs, dotted with tiny
cabins from which blue turf-smoke curled lazily.
Once they passed an old man riding a grey mare,
with his wife perched behind him on a pillion, holding
under her shawl a turkey in a sack, from the mouth of
which protruded the head of the indignant bird,
making loud protests. None of the women they met,
whether young or old, wore hats: all had the heavy
Irish shawl round head and shoulders,—and whether
the face that looked from the folds were that of a
withered old woman or a fresh and smiling colleen,
somehow the shawl seemed the best setting that could
have been devised for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Often, for miles and miles, they met no one and
passed no habitation: or perhaps the loneliness of the
way would be broken by a little thatched cabin, where
ragged children ran to the doorway, to gaze, round-eyed,
at the strangers. In one little town, however,
a fair was in progress, and the cobbled street presented
a lively spectacle. Men, women and children; asses,
ridden and driven; horses, cattle, sheep, and pigs,
and a few stray geese, mingled in loud-voiced confusion,
while dogs slipped hither and thither, managing
to intensify the urgency of any situation. To get
the big Rolls-Royce through such a concourse was
no easy task, and even with a people so good-humoured,
a tactless driver would have achieved swift
unpopularity. Sir John, however, was at the wheel
himself, and he slowed down to a crawl, sounding the
hooter occasionally, more in the manner of a gentle
suggestion than anything else. His Irish accent was
a shade more in evidence than usual as he exchanged
greetings with the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis a fine season we’re having, thank God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is, your honour. G’wan now, Mary Kate; get
the little ass out of the way of the mothor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, don’t be hurrying her. I have plenty of
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure ye’d need it, your honour, the place is that
throng.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that’s a good sign; it’s a great fair you’re
having!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well indeed, sir, it is not bad, thank God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Neill swerved to avoid an old woman in an ass-cart,
who was talking volubly to some neighbours,
while the ass took its own direction among the crowd.
Voices broke into swift upbraidings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take a howld of the ass there, will you, Maria
Cooney!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, wirra, it’s desthroyed she’ll be!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She will not, but the great mothor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it to scratch the beautiful paint ye would, with
the cart!” cried a wrathful man hauling the ass aside
bodily, while the unhappy Mrs. Cooney stammered out
excuses that no one heard, and blinked feebly at the
Rolls-Royce—which was pardonable, since she had
never seen one before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God help us, ’tis the heighth of a house!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry to disturb you, ma’am,” said O’Neill,
smiling at her distressed face. The crowd broke into
smiles in answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis not like the Englishman he is—the one that
galloped his machine over Ellen Clancy’s gander, an’
he goin’ to Rosapenna!” shrilled a voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watch him now—and the bonnivs under the
wheels of him!”—as a drove of fat pink pigs broke
through the crowd, scattered, in the infuriating manner
peculiar to pigs, and resisted all efforts to collect
them out of harm’s way. Their owner, a lean, black-whiskered
man, lifted up his voice and bewailed them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yerra, he have them thrampled! No—aisy, sir,
just a moment, till I get at him with a stick. That one
do be always in the wrong place.” He hauled a pig
bodily from beneath the car, retaining it by one leg,
while it drowned any other remarks with its shrieks,
and its companions scattered through the crowd,
pursued hotly by the dogs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry—I ought not to bring a motor through a
fair,” said O’Neill, willing to concede the right to the
road to the “bonnivs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’ why wouldn’t you?” said their owner, cheerfully.
“Many’s the time I’d not so much as the one
left to me when I’d brang ’em through, an’ I scourin’
every boreen after them. Let you go on, sir—it’s
all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The motor wormed its way along. When the crowd
grew less congested, O’Neill ventured to increase the
speed. Just as he did so, a small child, escaping from
its mother, who was driving a wordy bargain over a
matter of geese, toddled into the road in pursuit of a
fat puppy; and having caught it, sat down suddenly,
right in the path of the motor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A girl shrieked, and O’Neill wrenched the car to a
standstill, the bonnet not two yards from the baby.
Jim was out in the road in a flash, and picked up the
urchin, who showed considerable annoyance at the
escape of the puppy, but was otherwise quite unmoved,
and accepted a penny with a composure worthy of a
duke. The crowd collected anew with unbelievable
swiftness, and O’Neill groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis Maggie O’Hare’s baby. Woman, dear, where
are ye? an’ he after being nearly kilt on ye?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did ye see his honour pull up? An ass wouldn’t
have done it, an’ he dhrawin’ a cart!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I seen him sit down in the road, in-under the
mothor, an’ I knew he was dead, only I’d not time to
let a bawl out of me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it dead? Sure, look at him, an’ the big gentleman
carryin’ him, no less!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grinning he is, the way you’d say he was the best
boy in Ireland. Ah, that’s the dotey wee thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, that one has no fear at all. <span class='it'>He</span>’ll be the boy
for the trenches!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point Maggie O’Hare arrived breathlessly,
having just become aware of her son’s peril—with some
difficulty, owing to six of her friends having excitedly
explained the matter together. To an unprejudiced
onlooker, it would have seemed that her principal
maternal emotion was horror at finding her offspring
perched on Jim’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come down out of that, Micky—have behaviour,
now, an’ don’t be throublin’ the gentleman! Put
him down, sir—I’d not have you annoyed with him.”
She received Micky with much apparent wrath, but her
arms were tight round the little body. “Isn’t it the
rascal he is!—an’ I but lettin’ him out of me hand
that minute, the way I’d be feedin’ the goose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In England, Jim had learned to give tips; and for a
moment his hand sought his pocket. Fortunately, he
checked the impulse in time. The woman’s eyes
met his with the good breeding that lends something
of dignity to the poorest Irish peasant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a great boy,” he said, in his pleasant voice.
“Not a bit of fear in him—have you, Micky?” He
lifted his cap, and said “Good-bye,” striding back to
the motor. They moved on, slowly, leaving the little
town seething behind them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t altogether without incident to drive
through a fair!” said O’Neill, dreamily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towards evening they came to their halting-place
for the night—a grey village, nestling among brown
hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The inn used to be very fair, but one can’t guarantee
anything in war-time,” Sir John remarked.
“Of course it isn’t big enough to suffer from the complaint
that suddenly affected all the important hotels—the
hurried departure of French cooks and German
waiters. Many hotel-keepers will speak until the end
of their lives, with tears in their voices, about the
awful day when Henri and Gaston, and Fritz and
Karl, the props of their establishment, dropped their
aprons and fled to their respective Fatherlands. You
can’t convince those hotel-keepers that they do not
know all about the horrors of war!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This little place doesn’t suggest imported cooks
and waiters,” said Mr. Linton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, as I remember it, the landlady was the cook,
and her daughter the housemaid; and a nondescript
gentleman of the ‘odd-boy’ type doubled the parts
of boots, barkeeper, groom, and waiter, with any other
varieties of usefulness that might be demanded of him.
And there he is still, by the same token, bringing in a
load of turf.” Sir John indicated a wiry little man
leading a shambling old black horse bearing two creels
slung across his back, piled high with sods. He turned
into the back gateway of the inn as they drew up at
the front door; and, hearing the motor, cast a glance
over his shoulder, realized the presence of guests,
and administered a sounding slap on the black horse’s
quarter, disappearing hurriedly. They heard his
voice, shrilly summoning the unseen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is himself within?—let ye hurry! There’s a
pack of gentry at the door, in a mothor-car!” And a
voice yet more shrill:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wirra! An’ me fire black out—an’ what in the
world, at all, ’ll I give ’em for their dinners!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They made acquaintance with the problem a little
later when, hungry and cheerful, they gathered in the
long, low dining-room, where last year’s heather and
ling filled the fireless grate. The “odd-boy,” cleansed
beyond belief, awaited them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can we have for dinner?” O’Neill inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it dinner? Sure, anything you’d fancy, sir,”
said the “odd-boy,” with a nervous briskness that
somehow induced disbelief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m,” said Sir John, remembering the cry of woe
that had floated through the air, earlier. “Chops or
steaks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “odd-boy” shifted from one foot to the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afeard there’s none in the house, sir,” he said.
“ ’Tis the way the butcher——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh well—cold meat,” O’Neill said, cutting short
the butcher’s iniquities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir—certainly, sir!” said the “odd boy,” and
disappeared. There was an interval during which the
party admired the view and endeavoured to repress
the pangs of hunger. Finally the messenger reappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, sir,” he said, nervously. “Cold meat
is off, they do be tellin’ me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what can we have?” O’Neill said, losing the
finer edge of his patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “odd-boy” grew confidential.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis this way, sir,” he said. “The fair was yesterday:
an’ them cattle-jobbers have us ate out of the
house. So there’s just three things ye can have, sir:
an’ the first eggs; an’ the second’s bacon; and third
is eggs and bacon. An’ ye can have your choice-thing
of them three!”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HROUGH the tiny window of Norah’s room came
the soft sunlight which makes an Irish morning
so perfect a thing that to stay in bed a moment longer
than necessary would be criminal. Norah woke up,
and looked at it sleepily for a few minutes, wishing the
window were bigger. It had altogether declined to
remain open the night before, until she had propped
it with the water-jug, which now stood rakishly on
the sill, and had already excited considerable interest
and speculation in the street below. She dressed
quickly, somewhat embittered by the fact that investigation
discovered no sign of a bathroom. The
search was a nervous one, since the corridor seemed
principally to consist of shut doors; and after cautiously
opening one which looked promising, but
which revealed a tousled head on a pillow, with loud
snores saluting her, she was seized with panic, and fled
back to her own room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she emerged, fully dressed, she still seemed
the only person awake. Downstairs, however, she
encountered the “odd-boy,” who was sweeping the
hall with a lofty disregard of corners, wherein the
dust of many sweepings had accumulated in depressing
heaps. Through a cloud of dust he blinked in amazement
at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you wantin’ anything, miss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thanks,” Norah answered; “I was going for
a walk. Is there anything to see in the village?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “odd-boy” thought deeply, and finally replied
with gloom that he didn’t know why anybody
would be looking at it at all. Then, suddenly inspired,
he hastened to the door in Norah’s wake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s Willy Gallaher’s ould pig, miss, an’ she
after having eleven of the finest little ones yesterday.
Ye’d ought to see them. Willy’s the proud man.
’Twas himself was due for a bit of good luck, though,
with twins not a week old!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” said Norah, laughing. “But I’d rather
see the twins.” Which astounding preference left
the “odd-boy” gaping. Twins were a regrettable
everyday occurrence, but eleven “bonnivs” were the
gift of Providence, and not to be lightly regarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah made her way up the narrow street. The air
was full of the pleasant smell of newly-lit turf fires,
and in the cottages the women were beginning their
day’s work. Children ran to peep over the half-door
at the stranger, and Norah, peeping over in her turn,
saw fat babies crawling about the earthen floors and
made friends with them until their mothers picked
them up and brought them to the half-door for further
admiration. Thus her progress up the street was
slow, and it was some time before she came to the outskirts
of the village and crossed a green where asses,
geese, fowls, and long-haired goats wandered sociably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond the green the high road curved, and, following
it, Norah came upon a narrow river that tumbled
from the hills, racing under an old bridge of grey stone
in a mass of foaming rapids. On the other side was a
little ruined castle, upon which she advanced joyfully,
with the passion for anything old which gave the
Australians the keenest enjoyment of all their experiences
of travel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not much of a castle; the walls had long since
collapsed into heaps of broken stone, most of which
had been carried away to build cabins and were now
concealed under the whitewash of years. A small
square tower yet stood, but was obviously unsafe,
since the crumbling stairway that wound upwards
inside it had been shut off by rusty iron bars. It was
not easy to make out the outlines of what had been
rooms, for the stones had fallen in all directions, and
grass and brambles grew wildly over them. But
everywhere, softening the cruelty and destruction of
time, ivy clambered; a kindly cloak of green that
blotted out harsh outlines and turned the whole into
something exquisite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah crossed the bridge and climbed upon a half-fallen
wall, perching herself on a huge flat stone that
lay bathed in sunshine. Above her the jackdaws
which nested in the ivy-covered tower chattered and
scolded, flying in and out to their homes; below was
no sound save the hurried babble of the river, where
now and then came the flash of a leaping trout. It
was very peaceful. She tried to “reconstruct” it in
the way they loved, seeing again the old days when the
castle stood proudly, and chieftains and fair ladies,
richly clad, moved about the rooms and looked through
the narrow window slits at the river, running just as it
ran to-day. It was a fascinating employment; so
that she did not hear a light step, until a falling stone
brought her back to the present with a jump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I startle you?” Sir John asked, looking up at
her. “They told me you had gone out, and I guessed
that if you weren’t somewhere playing with a baby
you would have found the ruin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The babies and the ruin are both lovely,” Norah
said, smiling. “I’m taking them in turn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you sleep well?” Sir John asked, climbing
up to the wall, and lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, thanks; only the morning was too nice
to stay in bed. I had such a funny little room, all
nooks and corners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span> had a feather bed!” said Sir John, with a wry
face. “Awful things; I don’t know how people ever
slept on them. It was very huge and puffy, and I
sank down into its depths, and felt as if the waters
were closing over my head. Then I dreamed wild
dreams of battle. Altogether, I feel as if I had an
adventurous night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I read once of an old woman who slept on a turkey-feather
bed for twenty years, until at last all the
feathers stuck together in a solid mass like a mat, and
he had a sealskin coat made out of it!” said Norah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d love to believe it, but it beats any fishing-yarn
I ever heard,” said Sir John, regarding her fixedly.
“Do you believe it yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know anything about the ways of featherbeds,”
Norah said, laughing. “But I always thought
she must have been an unpleasant old lady, for it
showed clearly that she hadn’t shaken up her mattress
for twenty years. Oh, Sir John, did you find a bathroom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not; there isn’t one. I’m sorry, Norah.
We ought to have better luck at our stopping-place
to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose one can’t expect baths everywhere,”
Norah said. “The queer part to us is being charged
extra for one’s tub; no hotel in Australia ever does
anything so ungracious. They rather encourage one to
take baths there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a ridiculous charge, especially where a water-supply
is no trouble,” O’Neill answered. “Did I
ever tell you the story of a friend of mine who was
staying in a very old-fashioned country-house, where
his early cup of tea was brought in by a very old butler?
My friend asked for a bath, and was told there was
no hot water available—‘the pipes have froze on us,’
said the butler, sadly. Next day it was the same; but
the third morning the butler came in with triumph
in his eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Sure, the bath will be all right this morning,
sir,’ he said, confidentially. ‘I have the hot wather
beyant.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He went out, and returned panting under an
enormous bath of the flat tin-saucer variety, which
he put down with pride, while my friend—who happened
to be as big as your father—watched him,
much thrilled. Next he laid down a smart bath-mat,
and hung over a chair a bath-towel as large as a
sheet. Finally, he went out, and brought back a very
small can of hot water, which he poured very carefully
into the bath; as my friend said, it made a thin film
of wet on its great flat surface. The old butler straightened
up, beaming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Now, sir,’ he said, proudly—‘ye can have your
little dive!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah’s shout of laughter was echoed by Wally and
Jim, whose heads suddenly appeared over the ivy-covered
wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why you retire to ruins to tell your best
stories, O’Neill,” Jim said. “Also, we feel that it’s
breakfast-time, and we’ve been scouring the country
for you both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I begin to feel that way myself,” Norah said, jumping
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Linton was smoking in front of the hotel. In
the dining-room, the “odd-boy,” again thinly disguised
for the moment as a waiter, hovered about
their table for orders, a procedure which seemed superfluous,
since the possibilities of the house did not
exceed the inevitable bacon and eggs. No one, however,
was disposed to quarrel with the meal; and
very soon after, they were again on the road, leaving
the friendly little village by a winding highway that
soon brought them within sight and sound of the sea—one
of the deep inlets that thrust themselves far
into the wild northern coast of Ireland. The road
led, now close to the shore, now striking across country
to find a short cut over the neck of a peninsula. They
skirted little bays where a golden beach gleamed
invitingly, and ran out on rocky headlands, on which
the sullen sea thundered. Inland, the country grew
more and more lonely and desolate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How on earth do these people get a living?” Jim
ejaculated, looking at the wretched cabins in a tumbledown
village. “The soil is nearly all stone—and how
horribly bleak it must be in winter! This is July,
and still the wind is wild enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think they get much of a living at all,”
Sir John said. “Fishing helps, of course; and all
the able-bodied men hire themselves out for the harvesting
to Scotch and English farmers, and bring home
what seems a big sum in these parts, together with
stories of the wealth across the water:</p>

<p class='line0'>There’s not the smallest young gossoon but thravels in his shoes!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, they don’t do that here,” said Mr. Linton,
looking at the ragged boy by the wayside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not they—shoes only come with years of discretion,
and often, not then. But don’t they look
rosy and well?—nothing of the pinched look of the
youngsters in a city slum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—I think the air must be nourishing!” remarked
Wally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re quite right; it is. But they grow little
crops, in tiny corners between the stones. The soil is
bad enough; they are lucky if they are near the sea,
for then they can bring up mussels and kelp as manure.
There’s a woman bringing some now”; and Sir John
pointed to a bent figure, bare-legged, a red shawl over
head, and on her back a huge basket, beneath which
she was labouring up a steep cliff-path. “She has a
kish full of shell-fish there—you wouldn’t find it a light
load, even on the level, but they carry hundreds of
them up these cliffs. There are parts of Donegal so
bleak that they have to warm the ground before sowing
the seed; they burn the dried sea-weed on the
prepared soil, and sow the crop while the ashes are
still smoking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Scott!” said Jim, feebly. “Fancy an
Australian doing that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir John laughed grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fancy an Australian would flee in horror if he
were offered as a gift a tract of land that supports hundreds
of these people,” he said. “You should see
them reaping their tiny, pocket-handkerchief crops;
they do it with a little reaping-hook, and, upon my
word, some of them are so small that you might harvest
them with a pair of scissors! Of course they’re not
worth much; but then these people are accustomed
to live on very little, and they scarcely need more
than they have, if the sea is kind and the fishing fair.
They look wild enough; but they are intelligent, even
if ignorant, and you will always meet with courtesy
among them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They would make great fighting men,” Jim observed,
watching a broad-shouldered, dark-faced young
fellow who was digging in a tiny field by the road.
He had paused to look at the motor, one foot on the
spade, and his splendid young body upright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, every sound Irishman is that naturally,”
Sir John said, with a laugh. “And the women could
do their bit if occasion arose. Did you hear, by the
way, of the women of Limerick, when some of the
disaffected idiots of whom there are too many in the
country made a pro-German demonstration there
lately? They chose a day when most of the loyal men
of the city were away; these fellows were from Dublin,
and they made a procession and planned quite a little
show. But they reckoned without the women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What—did they take a hand?” asked Mr. Linton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They did, indeed, with sticks and stones and whatever
other missiles came handy. It was most effective:
they broke up the procession completely, and
the gallant rebels had to be rescued by the police.
The women had a great day. I asked one why they
didn’t leave the matter entirely to the police, and she
looked at me in scorn and asked why would they
accommodate themselves with the ignorance of policemen?
And indeed, I didn’t know. After all, some
things are managed much better without the law.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road had for some time been leading away from
the sea, and now began to climb up a steep cutting,
between rock-walls fringed with ferns and mosses. On
the hills above them a few goats browsed, their kids
cutting capers among the boulders, with complete
enjoyment of the game. They mounted steadily for
awhile; then, topping the rise, began to glide downwards.
The road turned and twisted as they neared
the level ground, following the course of a little stream
that came rushing from some unseen source. Sir
John, who was driving, sounded his horn steadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are not many people on these roads,” he
said, over his shoulder. “But it doesn’t do to take
risks with the country folk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Still, I never saw a more desolate road, so
far as traffic goes,” Mr. Linton answered. “We have
not seen a soul for miles on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think there <span class='it'>is</span> a soul on it,” said Sir John,
laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The motor swung round a corner, with a prolonged
hoot; and there, so close that the bonnet of the car
seemed almost to be touching the ass’s nose, came an
old woman, nodding sleepily in a cart. There was
no time to stop, and no room to turn. The ass planted
all four feet stubbornly, stopping dead, and they heard
a faint cry from the shawled old figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit tight,” said O’Neill between his teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brake jammed hard on as he spoke; they had
been running down-hill slowly, with the power shut
off. The ass backed indignantly; and the great
motor swerved to one side, where there was a little
more room in the cutting, bumped heavily over dry
channels worn by the winter rains, and rammed her
bonnet gently into the rock wall. The occupants of
the tonneau found themselves in a heap on the floor.
The car throbbed to silence, and the old woman in the
ass-cart said, “God help us!” loudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, indeed, He did,” said O’Neill, under his
breath. “Are you all right, all of you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re mixed, but undamaged,” Jim answered.
“What about you, O’Neill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m all right. How is she, Con?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Con had swung himself out before the car finally
stopped, and was examining the battered bonnet
dismally, finally appealing for help to push her away
from the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a minute,” O’Neill said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked over to the old woman, who still sat
motionless on the floor of the ass-cart, her withered
face pitifully afraid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you not hear the horn?” O’Neill asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did, sir—but I didn’t rightly know what it was,
an’ I half asleep.” She rocked herself to and fro,
wretchedly. “Oh, wirra, the great mothor! Is it
desthroyed entirely, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not—but it’s the mercy of Heaven we’re not
all killed, and you and the little ass, too. When you
hear that horn, mother, get to one side of a road
quickly: and don’t be afraid to call out, if it happens
to be a narrow road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” She looked at him helplessly,
her voice breaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry—you’re all right,” he said gently.
“Is it tired you are?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I been sittin’ up with my son these two nights,”
she said, finding words. “Mortal ill he was, an’ the
woman he married no more use than a yalla-haired
doll. An’ when they’re sick they do be wantin’ their
mothers again, like as if they’d gone back to be little
boys.” Just for a moment he caught a gleam of
triumph in her dulled eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is he better?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is, sir, God be praised, and I’m gettin’ home
to me man; there’s no knowin’ what he’ll have done
to himself, not used to bein’ alone and all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something passed from O’Neill’s palm into the
trembling, work-worn old hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s to bring you luck for your son,” he said,
forestalling her protests. “Let you get home, mother,
and have a meal. Wait a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He unscrewed the cap of his flask, and made her
drink out of the silver cup, to her own great horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I’d a tin, itself!” she protested. “But your
honour’s cup!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drink it up,” said O’Neill, unmoved. He took
back the cup and stood aside; and the little ass moved
on, the old woman calling down blessings upon him,
with tears finding well-accustomed furrows down her
cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sitting up two nights, and probably doing the
work of the house during the day, in addition to nursing;
and most likely on bread and stewed black
tea!” said O’Neill, indignantly, striding back to the
motor. “You wouldn’t wonder if she went to sleep in
front of the car of Juggernaut. Poor old soul! I say,
you people have been busy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had levered the heavy car back, chocking the
wheels with great stones, and the chauffeur was making
explorations into her vital parts. Sir John joined
him, and they discoursed unintelligibly in technical
language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it might be worse, but it’s not too good,”
Sir John said, at last, emerging from the investigation
and wiping his hands on a ball of cotton-waste.
“There’s no moving her without men and horses,
and no getting her going again until we get some spare
parts; and they’re no nearer than Belfast or Dublin;
possibly we shall have to telegraph to London for
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she’s not desthroyed entirely?” Norah said,
happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is not. Hadn’t we the luck of the world that
it happened where it did, just on level ground and
where there was a little room to manœuvre! If it
had been three minutes earlier, on the side of the hill,
in the narrow cutting, we should simply have gone
clean over the poor old soul and her ass. Nothing
could have saved them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might easily have been infinitely worse,” Mr.
Linton said. “But I’m sorry for the car, O’Neill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the car’s nothing,” Sir John answered, cheerfully.
“I’m only sorry for the interruption to our
trip. However, things might be more uncomfortable.
We’re only three or four miles from Carrignarone,
where I meant to stop the night: there is quite a
passable inn there, small and homely, but it’s clean
and comfortable enough. We could stay there for a
few days, while Con goes to Belfast to get what is
necessary—that is, if you like. The coast is interesting,
and we might get some sea-fishing. Of course, if you
thought that too slow, we could drive to the railway,
and get back to Killard.” He looked rather wistful.
“I had hoped this was going to be such a jolly trip,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, so it is,” Jim responded. “I’m awfully
sorry for the damage to the motor, but we’re going to
have plenty of fun all the same. It will be rather good
fun to be on a coast again, and we’re all keen on sea-fishing.
And you know, O’Neill, we wouldn’t make
any definite plans, so that the unexpected could take
charge of us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has certainly done that,” Sir John said, laughing.
“Well, I think the next thing is lunch: a good
thing I got the hotel to put us up something, though
it will probably be only hard-boiled eggs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It <span class='it'>was</span> hard-boiled eggs, and they ate them merrily,
sitting on the bank of the little stream, where lichen-covered
boulders, smooth and weather-worn, made
convenient seats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am perfectly certain,” Mr. Linton said, “that
if I were in London and ate an enormous meal of
soda-bread, eggs like bullets, and very black tea out of
a Thermos, I should have dyspepsia. Not that I ever
had it; but the mixture sounds dyspeptic when you
couple it with London. But sitting on the bank of a
Donegal river it seems quite the proper thing, and I
shall be very well after it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one could be anything but well in Donegal,”
Wally said, decisively. “Whew-w, Jim! think of the
trenches, in a fortnight!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d rather not, if you don’t mind,” said Jim,
lighting his pipe. “I want my little hit-back at Brer
Boche, but I’d much rather it was in the open: there’s
no romance in war when you carry it on in an over-populated
ditch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucky young animals!” said Sir John, openly
envious—and the boys flushed a little. As a rule,
they were careful not to talk of the Front in the presence
of the man whose whole soul longed to be out
there with them. “But you’ll all come back, won’t
you? and Mr. Linton, when the war is over, or when
these ancient campaigners next get leave, you will
bring them back to Rathcullen? I want to know
that that is a settled thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a matter which I don’t need to put to the
committee,” Mr. Linton replied, looking at the cheery
faces. “We’ll certainly come, O’Neill, since you are
so good. And then, when we pack up finally for
Australia and Billabong, what about you? You
know it’s high time you visited that little country of
ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s coming with us,” said Norah, with decision.
“Say you are, Sir John—please!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, indeed, I begin to think I am,” O’Neill
answered. “I was getting terribly old when you
invaded Donegal, but now I believe I shall soon be
nearly as young as Mr. Linton! At any rate, I might
follow you out.” But the boys protested, arguing
that there was no point in travelling alone when they
might make a family party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be miles jollier,” said Wally. “Then
we could ‘personally conduct’ you to Billabong, and
you would have the unforgettable experience of seeing
Brownie go mad. I’m quite certain she and Murty
will be delirious on the day that Norah comes marching
home again!” So they planned happily, in gay
defiance of the guns thundering across the Channel.
That sullen menace was only a fortnight ahead, and
already Norah dreamed of it at night. But in the
daytime it was better to pretend that it did not
exist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Con was left with the motor, to administer what
“first-aid” was possible: and after lunch the rest of
the party set off along the road to Carrignarone, which
was reached after an easy walk of an hour and a half.
It was a little fishing-village, boasting a better inn than
others of its type, since in normal years the sport to be
obtained brought a small harvest of visitors. War,
however, had meant lean times—wherefore the people
of the inn fell thankfully on the windfall afforded
them by a stranded party of six, and ran three ways
at once in preparing for their comfort. A cart, with
a couple of strong horses, was forthcoming, and under
the charge of Jim and Wally, set off to the rescue of
the motor—which was eventually towed into the
village, where it caused what the war-reports term “a
certain liveliness.” At the steering-wheel sat Con, a
picture of humiliation—deepening to disgust when
the carter politely offered him a whip!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Them machines do be all very well to play with,
for genthry an’ for them that have too much money,”
said the carter, drawing a distinction that was not lost
on his hearers. “But ’tis mighty glad they are of the
ould horses when annything goes wrong with the
works!” Which was so obviously true at the moment
that no one had any spirit to contradict him.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>ALLY ran out upon a point of rock that ended
abruptly in a sheer face, under which the
outgoing tide ran swiftly, deep and green. For a
moment he stood motionless, his slim body gleaming
white against sea and rock; then he curved forward
and shot into the water in a clean dive that made
scarcely any splash. He reappeared, shaking the
water from his eyes, his brown face glowing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Coo-ee, Jim! Come on—it’s ripping!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim appeared from a cave, shedding the last of his
raiment. There was no pause in his dive; his swift
rush along the point ended in a leap that carried him
far out, and when he emerged, strong over-arm strokes
carried him quickly in towards a tiny bay where hard
yellow sand made a perfect landing-place. Wally
gave chase, unavailingly: when his feet touched the
shore Jim was already racing again along the rocks,
his dive this time beginning with a complete somersault
in the air, before, with a mighty splash, he disappeared
once more. Wally came hard upon his heels,
springing in, in a sitting position, his hands locked
under his knees; and for the next twenty minutes
the chums sported in the water like a couple of seals,
racing, playing tricks upon each other, and practising
the dozen different dives taught them in schoolboy
days in Australia. Finally they rubbed themselves
down with dry, warm sand, donned their clothes,
and subsided, glowing, on a sunny rock, to light their
pipes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a perfect place for a swim!” Jim said,
looking at the long, narrow inlet with its twin headlands.
“That point only needs one thing, Wal—a
really good spring-board.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Do you remember the big spring-board in
the St. Kilda baths—the one you broke when you were
trying how high you could spring before diving?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I not!” said Jim ruefully. “It was the pride
of the baths, and replacing it made me a poor man for
the rest of the term!” He pitched a shell far out
into the sea. “Doesn’t that seem ages ago!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is: anything that happened before the war
<span class='it'>is</span> ages ago,” Wally answered. “And I suppose, when
we get back to Billabong, all this”—he swept a comprehensive
gesture that included Ireland and Europe—“will
seem a kind of prehistoric dream. Anyhow it’s a
good dream while it lasts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s all too good to have missed it,” Jim
said. “Ireland has been jolly, beyond our hopes,
thanks to O’Neill—what a brick that poor chap is!
Now if we can only finish up by a bit of real fighting,
it will all be a huge lark. I’m not a scrap sorry to have
been in the trenches; it was all good experience.
But I say, Wal, I do want to get going above
ground!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather!” Wally answered. “I want to take a
hand in a general worry, and afterwards to be in it
when we chase the lovely Hun back to his happy home.
And I specially want to be there when we chase ’em
out of Brussels: I’d like to see that plucky Belgian
King marching down his main street again. Won’t
they howl!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll all howl when that day comes,” said Jim.
“You know, Ireland has been just topping, and it’s
jolly to be with old dad and Norah again; but I’m
beginning to think it’s about time we got back to work.
We’re fit as possible now; and we didn’t sign on to
play about. This sort of thing”—he touched his
rough tweed clothes—“was all very well when we
were crocks. But we aren’t crocks now. I think, of
course, that it was only common sense to get quite
fit; they don’t want half-cured people over yonder.
Still——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, being cured, it’s time we dug out our khaki
again,” Wally said, nodding. “I quite agree: one
would begin to feel a shirker if one stayed much longer.
And Australians haven’t shown themselves shirkers
in this war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. It’s funny, you know,” Jim reflected. “I
did hate the trenches—the filth, and the flies, and the
smells, and the vermin; and I used to wonder if I
was a tin-soldier, and had no business to have come
at all, because lots of chaps say they love it, no matter
what the conditions are. Well, I didn’t love it; I’d
sooner have driven bullocks, any day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Same here,” said Wally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It used to buck me that you felt the same,” Jim
said, “because of course I knew you weren’t any tin-soldier,
and the other fellows used to say how keen
you were, and that you’d get on well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they said just the same to me about you, you
old ass!” said Wally laughing. “Who got a special
pat on the back at the last inspection, I’d like to
know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that was only luck,” said Jim, much embarrassed.
“Bit of eye-wash for the C.O. Anyway,
I used to worry for fear I wasn’t any good at the game;
and it worried me that I was so awfully glad to come
away, after they gassed us. But lately, I’ve been a
bit bucked, because I’m getting no end keen to be
back. We’ll hate it again, I’m certain. But one has
got to see the job through. You feel it too, don’t
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’M,” nodded Wally. “I suppose it’s just the
beastliness one hates, but one likes one’s job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect so. I used to get horribly annoyed with
young Wilson, in my platoon, but I’d like uncommonly
to know how the little beggar is shaping now,
and who has the handling of him. He’s a queer-tempered,
obstinate, cross-grained varmint, but he’ll
do anything for you if you treat him like a human
being. Only you can’t drive him. I hope we’ll get
our old crowds back—though I’m afraid it’s rather
too much to hope for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid so,” Wally agreed. “My corporal was
a dear old thing; only he would persist periodically
in forgetting that I was grown-up. I don’t blame
them—the old N.C.O.’s know ever so much more than
we do. That chap had been all over the world, and
seen no end of service; he’d have had a commission
if he could have kept off beer. It was when he was
drunk that he used to think I was his small boy. I
had my own troubles with him”—and Wally grinned
reminiscently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were such a good lot of fellows,” Jim said.
“Oh, it will be pretty good to get back; and to see
Anstruther and Garrett and Blake, and all the crowd
again, and make them fight their battles over for us.
It’s one of the annoying parts about our dose of gas
that I haven’t the slightest recollection of our own
little scrap. I used to remember the beginning;
but now my only memory is of you sitting on a biscuit-tin
eating bully, and I’m sure that happened before
the fun began. I wonder if the other fellows will have
much to talk about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, <span class='it'>we</span> won’t, anyhow,” Wally said. “Ireland
isn’t the place for adventures. Let’s hope we may
get some good specimens of our own in Flanders—and
in Germany—and then we needn’t envy any of ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather!” assented Jim. “I say, suppose we
move on—the sun isn’t as hot as it was, or I’m colder
than I was; and anyhow, we may as well explore.”
He sprang up, followed by his chum, and they strolled
across the rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The party had been at Carrignarone for three days,
and there was, as yet, no word from Con, who had
departed on an outside car, <span class='it'>en route</span> to Belfast, to
obtain what was necessary to restore the motor to
health. Not that anyone minded the delay. The
little inn was clean and well-kept; the sea-fishing was
good, and the bathing perfect; while the shore, with
its alternating strand and rock, was a never-failing
fascination. Wally and Jim had made friends with
an old fisherman, who had taken them out with him
very early that morning; and luck had been so good
that they had come in some hours earlier than they
were expected, so that the big haul they brought could
be taken to the railway and landed in Dublin in time
for the next morning’s market. At the inn, they found
that Sir John, Norah, and Mr. Linton had gone out,
leaving no word of their movements; so the boys,
after an enormous lunch, had departed to explore
the shore farther than their previous walks had led
them, until the long narrow inlet had tempted them
to bathe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They strolled round the beach from the point where
they had dived, now and then picking up a curious
shell or some sea-treasure that might be included
in the parcels that went periodically to Billabong,
where Brownie would have cherished the veriest
rubbish if only her nurslings had gathered it for her.
The tide was almost out, and at the farther headland
the rocks lay uncovered for a long way, full of alluring
rock-pools, gleaming with sea-anemones. It was impossible
to round the point, however, for it was higher
than the other headland, and the water roared at
its base, even at low tide; so they strolled back across
the rocks, looking for the nearest place where it would
be possible to climb up and cross the point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crags above them grew more accessible presently,
and they scrambled up, slipping and clambering
until they found themselves on a jutting rock with a
wide flat surface, which, bathed in sunshine, invited
them to stop and rest. Loose fragments of rock lay
about the flat top, and Wally perched on one, but
rose hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That thing wriggled under me,” he said, “It’s
just on the balance: I believe I could push it over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘That Master Wally have the mischieviousness
of ten boys,’ as Brownie used to say,” Jim remarked,
lazily. “Sit down, and don’t play tricks with the
landscape.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be considerably like hard work, so I
don’t think I will,” said Wally, sitting down on another
fragment. “This old table of a rock wants tidying
up, I think—did you ever see so many loose chunks
scattered about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect a bit of the cliff fell on it from above, and
flew into bits,” said Jim. “Anyhow, it’s warm and
jolly. What’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something tinkled on the rock, and Wally uttered a
sharp exclamation of annoyance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Botheration! That’s my knife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hard luck!” said Jim, looking at a cleft in the
surface, down which the knife had vanished. “Never
mind; I’ve got two with me, and you can have one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, but I don’t want to lose that fellow,”
Wally said, vexedly. “It’s that extra-special knife
Norah gave me when I was going out—the big one she
called ‘the lethal weapon.’ It’s full of all sorts of
dodges. I’d sooner lose a lot of odd things than that
knife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lay flat, and put his eye to the cleft in the rock,
peering downwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid it’s gone for good, old man,” Jim said.
“It’s hard luck—but Norah will understand. She’ll
probably jump at the chance of giving you another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want this one,” said Wally, his voice slightly
muffled. He peered harder. “I say, Jim, I can see
daylight down here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how you can,” Jim said, leaning over
in his turn. “This old rock seems pretty solid. Let’s
look.” He applied his eye to the cleft, in his turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there is light,” he said presently, sitting up.
“I wonder if there’s some opening below, Wal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t know, but I’m going to see,” Wally answered.
He swung himself over the edge of the flat
rock and climbed down, followed by his chum. They
hunted about the great pile, seeking for some opening
that might explain the glimmer of daylight that had
greeted them above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On one side of the mass was the long stretch of rock
from which they had first climbed up; but on the
other they found smooth hard sand, only lately under
water. There were openings here and there among
the boulders, but they led to nothing, and had no
communication with the upper air; they explored
them in turn, but found no solution of the problem.
Then, as Wally was backing out on hands and knees
from one of these false scents, he heard a low whistle
from Jim, and hurried round a boulder, to find him
regarding what looked like a slit, about three feet
high, between two masses of rock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s some sort of a cave in there,” Jim said.
“I’ve been in a little way, and it looks rather interesting,
so I came back for you. There’s light far
above one’s head; I believe we’ll find your knife
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crawled into the narrow passage. Almost
immediately it turned, so sharply that a casual searcher
might easily have been misled into thinking it ended:
and then it widened and they found themselves in a
long, narrow cave. They could see no roof; but far
above, a faint bar of light glimmered, and made it
possible to see where they were going. Underfoot
was hard sand. The walls were dripping with wet
and encrusted with seaweeds and limpets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a real sea-cave,” Wally said cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An echo took his voice and went muttering round
the rocks, the mutter rising at length almost to a cry.
It was an eerie sound, in the wet dusk of the cave,
with the dark smell of a submerged place in their
nostrils; and the boys jumped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess this isn’t a place to raise one’s voice in,”
Wally said, dropping his to a whisper. “That’s a
nice, tame echo; I’d like to take it back to Billabong!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you!” uttered Jim, with feeling. “The
blacks would say it was the Bunyip come back; and
anyhow, you’d get into trouble for bringing out a prohibited
immigrant.” He made a quick pounce on an
object that glittered faintly on the sand. “There’s
your knife, old man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless you!” said Wally, thankfully receiving his
property. “I say, what luck! and haven’t you the
eye of a hawk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I kicked it,” said Jim. “A good thing it’s
so big: I always thought Norah gave it to you with
the idea that you might club a few Germans with it,
if you got the chance—and scalp ’em afterwards.
Get out!—” as Wally tipped his cap off. “Remember
that you’re in a subterranean locality, and behave as
such. Hark at that echo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had raised his voice, unwittingly, and the echo
had sent it shrieking round the cave. It was quite a
relief when the sound died away to a low murmur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not at all sure that it isn’t the Bunyip, an’
he livin’ here at his aise, as Con would say,” Wally
muttered. “Come on; we’ll see how far this place
goes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light grew dimmer as they moved on, away from
the crack overhead. Fortunately, Jim was never to
be found without a tiny electric torch in his pocket,
and its little beam of light was sufficiently to guide
them. But for the torch their explorations would
certainly have come to an end immediately, for it
was not half a minute before they found themselves
against a wall that apparently ended the cave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it isn’t much of a cavern, after all,” Jim
remarked. “Not bad as a dressing-room for Norah,
if she wants to bathe from this beach—there’s clear
sand right down to the water from the entrance in one
place. She will have to come at low tide, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flashed his torch into the comers as they turned
to retrace their steps. One was plainly nothing but
solid wall: but in the other something caught his eye;
a darker patch of shadow that was not quite like the
rock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I believe there’s an opening in that corner,”
he said. “It must be another cave, communicating
with this one. Come and see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The opening was only wide enough to admit one at a
time, and so screened by a jutting boulder that it was
almost invisible. Within was a cave very like the
first one, though much larger; differing from it, too,
in that the sand ended, and the floor was of fairly
smooth rock, which, in the middle, held a great pool of
water. This time there was no doubt that they were
at the end of their subterranean journey; Jim flashed
the light right round the wall, but there was no break
in the solid rock, glistening with wet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s the finish,” Wally said. “It isn’t a
wildly exciting place, except for that demoniacal echo.
We’ll bring Norah and the others here and make it
talk. I’d like to hear what its little efforts would be
like if one gave a football yell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something would break,” said Jim, suppressing a
laugh. He strolled across to the pool, and turned the
light on its black surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a deep and mysterious and probably,
haunted water-hole and you’d better be careful,”
said Wally in a sepulchral whisper. “Most likely
the Bunyip lives there, and in a moment we shall see
his grisly head emerge from the unfathomed depths,
and then all will be over with two promising young
officers of His Majesty’s Army.” He paused for
breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Idiot!” said Jim, pleasantly. “I wonder if it’s
deep. Lend me your stick, Wal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned over the pool and thrust the stick into its
depths. It went in for its full length. Then came a
sound which made the boys look at each other in bewilderment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds as if the Bunyip had been chucking his
old tins in,” Wally said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s tin, I’ll swear,” Jim answered. “And solid
at that; I can’t move it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took off his coat, rolled his shirt-sleeve to the
shoulder, and recommenced investigations. It was
easy enough to feel the stick scraping on tin; beyond
that, he could make out nothing, save that there was
plenty of tin to scrape. Jim desisted at length, and
stood pondering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think this is pretty queer,” he said, presently.
“Wonder if we’ve stumbled on a smuggler’s cave, Wal.
Look here, I’m going to paddle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you don’t know the depth of that beastly
place,” Wally said. “For all we know it may be miles
deep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, can’t I swim?” Jim queried in amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, a little. Anyhow, I’m coming, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim laughed softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought that was it,” he said. “Look here—you
stay at the edge with the light, and I’ll hold one
end of the stick, and you can hang on to the other.
That will make it all right. There’s no sense in out
both paddling in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally assented, more or less reluctantly; and Jim
took off his boots and stockings and rolled his trouser-legs
high. Then, he stepped carefully into the black
pool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove, it’s cold!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the bottom like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fairly smooth.” He moved on, becoming less
cautious. Then he uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up?” came from Wally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve stubbed my silly toe against something—my
own fault.” Jim answered. “Why, it’s another
tin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stooped, feeling in the water. Presently he let
go of the stick, and plunged both hands in: and in a
moment turned, carrying something that was evidently
heavy. He put it on the rock at the edge of the pool,
and stepped out of the water. Wally flashed the light
on the treasure-trove, and then whistled softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Petrol!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The pool is full of it, I believe: I felt lots of other
tins.” He turned the big square can over and over,
finding no mark upon it. “H’m. Now I’m going to
put it back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why are you in such a hurry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I don’t know whom we have to deal
with,” Jim said. He waded in again and replaced
the heavy tin, returning quickly, and picking up his
boots and stockings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slip out and reconnoitre, carefully,” he said.
“Take care that you aren’t seen. Find out if anyone
is in sight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wally returned in a few minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a soul,” he reported. “And there’s not a
footmark visible on the sand, except our own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s good, anyhow,” Jim said. “We’ll get out
of this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led the way out, not speaking until they were
clear of the rocks near the cave. Then he sat down,
and for the first time the two boys looked at each
other. Their faces were grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s submarines, of course?” Wally asked. “Germans?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t be anything else. And what a depôt!
Look at this inlet—shut in by the headlands, with a
perfect sandy bottom: a submarine could come in
here and lie in complete safety, and no one would
ever dream of looking for her. The cave is not five
minutes from the water’s edge, even at low tide—of
course, no one could get in to it at all unless the tide
were right out: when it is in there’s a foot of water
over the entrance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—and at low tide the sand is as hard as iron,”
Wally said, excitedly. “They could fill their collapsible
boat with petrol tins in ten minutes with two
or three men to fish them out of the water and a few
more to carry them down. Oh, Jimmy, we’ve got to
bag them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather!” Jim answered. “The question is,
how?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thought deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must be awfully careful,” he said, at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s much too big and important for us to mess up by
trying to keep it to ourselves. But there isn’t a
policeman in the district, and if there were, he might
mess it up as badly as ourselves. We’ve got to get a
patrol-boat round to the inlet somehow; you know
they’re all round the coast, and it wouldn’t take long
to bring one here. But one doesn’t know whom to
trust. The Germans may be getting help from on
shore, for all we can tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course they may,” Wally cried. “People say
there are plenty of pro-Germans about; and they’d
pay well enough to tempt these peasantry. But all
the people we’ve talked to in Carrignarone seem just as
keen as we are about the war. I don’t believe they’re
in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither do I, but it’s hard to tell,” Jim answered.
“Oh, it’s maddening!—the brutes may come in to-night,
for all we know! We can telegraph to the
nearest coastguard station, of course, or wherever one
can catch a patrol-boat—there are some sort of instructions
about submarines and aeroplanes posted
up in every post-office. But she might not be in
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose we can trust the postmistress?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we can’t, we’re done,” Jim said. “If only the
motor were all right we needn’t trust anyone. Isn’t
it simply sickening to think we may do the wrong
thing altogether? And if we make a mistake, and
the submarine gets away with a fresh supply of petrol,
she may sink half a dozen <span class='it'>Lusitanias</span> before she is
caught!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve just got to get her,” Wally said, between
his teeth. “It seems to me there’s only one thing
to do: we must telegraph for the patrol-boat, and,
meanwhile, watch every night at low tide. It’s a
comfort that they can’t get into the cave at any other
time, isn’t it? I say, Jim, your father said we were
kids to bring our revolvers with us—but isn’t it a
mercy we did!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather!” Jim said. The revolvers had been new
toys; they had not felt able to part from them.
“And O’Neill has one, too—you remember, he said
we might have some shooting-practice in these lonely
parts and teach Norah how to use one.” He became
silent, suddenly, and Wally, watching his thoughtful
face, did not interrupt him. After a while he spoke,
half-apologetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Wal, old chap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” Jim said. “It’s your show as much
as mine, of course, and I won’t do anything to which
you don’t agree. But——” he stopped again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do go on!” said Wally. “Say it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s just this. We’ll get lots of shows later
on, if we’ve any luck: not so important as this, perhaps,
but still, there ought to be chances. Anyhow,
we’re able to go out to the Front and do our bit. And
that poor chap isn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O’Neill?” Wally said. “No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—do you see what I mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It takes brains,” said Wally, laughing. “But I
think I do. You want to make this his show?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wouldn’t hurt us,” he said. “He is such a
brick, and he’s eating his heart out over the whole
thing. It’s just the toughest sort of luck—and here
he is, knocking about with us and giving us a ripping
time, and you’d think that every time he looks at us
it must remind him of what he wants to have and
can’t. And now here’s a thing he could be right in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather!” Wally said. “I’m jolly glad you
thought of it, old man. And it isn’t any beautiful
sacrifice on our parts, either, for he has tons more
brains than we have, and he’s a first-class shot. Let’s
get him to run it altogether, and we’ll be his subalterns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim sighed with relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seemed a bit hard to ask you to give up the
credit,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what about you?” grinned Wally</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, credit be hanged!” said Jim, laughing.
“Anyhow, we’ll get all the fun!”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>J</span>OHN O’NEILL was dressing for dinner: an operation
which consisted in putting on a clean soft
collar and brushing his hair, since the travellers’ possibilities
of toilet were limited to one small kit-bag
apiece. To him there came a discreet knock on the
door; and Wally and Jim, suitably apologetic, appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look like conspirators,” said Sir John, surveying
the pair. “What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve struck a job that’s a size too large for us,”
Jim answered. “So we’ve come meekly to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Neill’s short laugh was rather bitter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too large for <span class='it'>you</span>!” he said. “If that’s the case,
it would be rather an out-size for me, I should say.”
His look travelled over the two tall lads, wiry and
powerful. “Unless—it isn’t money, I suppose, Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed; it’s brains!” Jim answered. “And
we haven’t got any. Anyhow, we don’t know how to
handle this situation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m at your disposal,” Sir John said. “Fire
away—there’s plenty of time before dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve found a little submarine supply-depôt,”
Jim said. “What does one do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Neill dropped his brush, and stared at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say it much as you might say, ‘We’ve found
a mushroom: how do we cook it?’ ” he uttered. “It
isn’t a joke, Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed it’s not,” the boy said, quickly. “It’s
because it’s so horribly serious that we’ve come to
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a little inlet about a couple of miles up the
coast,” Jim said. “Funny little shut-in place: you
could sail past it outside and never notice it, the headlands
are so close together.” He described their discovery
briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Neill sat down on the side of his bed and knitted
his brows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, the first thing is to get a patrol-boat
down,” he said. “As it happens, I know Bob Aylwin,
who is in command of one of them: his headquarters
are at Port Brandon, and he could get here quite
quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we must telegraph, I suppose,” Jim said.
“But we were wondering if it would be safe; things
leak out so quickly in a tiny place like this, and you
know that people ashore are said to be helping the
submarines in some districts. One doesn’t like to
misjudge anyone, but——” He paused, knitting his
brows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One has to suspect every one,” O’Neill said,
shortly. “And telegrams are horribly public things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only the motor were available!” Wally said,
anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stared at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you know Con was back? He turned up
early this morning, with the things he went for: and
he and a handy man he picked up have been inside her
bonnet ever since. He came in just now to report
that she is ready to start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, good business!” ejaculated Jim. “Will you
send him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Neill thought swiftly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can trust Con absolutely,” he said. “But he’s
an ignorant lad, and he is lame. Would your father
go with him, do you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll do anything,” Jim said, quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wally, will you bring him here?” O’Neill asked.
“Hurry!” He sprang to the table and opened a
touring map of Donegal. “Where’s your inlet, Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” Jim replied, promptly, indicating a tiny
indentation on the rugged coast-line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Neill drew a line round it with a red pencil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be quite clear on Aylwin’s charts, of course,”
he said. “This will be sufficient guide to begin with.
Now can you draw a rough plan of the cave and the
path down to the water? I’ll explain to your father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Linton came hurrying in, and at Sir John’s
request Wally told him the story, illustrating it with
Jim’s drawing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know the inlet,” David Linton said; “I walked
past it the other day when I was out for an early-morning
stroll. Queer, land-locked corner: I marked
it down as a good bathing-place for you youngsters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s excellent, for you’ll be able to direct them
by land, if necessary. Now, will you go in the motor
to Port Brandon, Mr. Linton? it’s only twenty miles,
and Con knows the roads. They’re not good, but he’ll
get you there quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do anything you like,” David Linton said.
“What will you do here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir John had taken instinctive command of the
situation. For a few moments he did not speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aylwin must use his own judgment about coming,”
he said. “He may not want to appear here in daylight,
for fear of scaring the enemy away; on the
other hand, they may be here already, lying snugly
on the bottom of the inlet, and only waiting for night
and low water to get the petrol. You say the pool
was full of it, Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So far as I could tell. I poked with a stick from
one side, and waded in from the other. The tins are
stacked in it; I don’t think they can have taken any
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the more likely that they will soon be in,”
O’Neill said. “I knew they had been in the north
lately; the brutes nearly got one of our transports.
But if Aylwin shows up off the mouth of the inlet he
may scare them away altogether. If one knew what
was best to do! We’ve got to bag them!” His eyes
were dancing. “Great Scott! what a chance it is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came a knock at the door, and Norah’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is dad here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conspirators looked at each other guiltily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Norah must be told,” Jim said. “She’s perfectly
safe; and we can’t carry on this without explaining
to her, poor kid. May she come in, O’Neill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir John was already at the door. Norah, her face
troubled, spoke hurriedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been looking everywhere for dad or the boys.
Are they here, Sir John?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in, if you don’t mind,” O’Neill said, holding
the door open. He closed it carefully behind
her. “We’re having a council of war, Norah,
and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim interrupted him, watching his sister’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there anything wrong with you, Nor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s something I thought I’d better tell you,”
Norah said. “I went along the road just now with
some sweets for those babies in the end cottage, beyond
the village; and coming back I got over the
bank into the field to get some wild flowers. Just
as I was going to climb back I heard voices, and I
peeped through the hedge and saw two men—men in
rough clothes. They had been buying things in the
village, for they had parcels, and some bread that
wasn’t wrapped up. So I bobbed down behind the
hedge until they had gone past—they didn’t look nice,
somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Jim. “Did they see you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it’s a lonely bit of the road, and there are no
houses. I don’t suppose they even thought of any
one being there. And, Jim, they were talking in
German!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly. I couldn’t make out what they said,
for their voices were very low—and anyhow I never
learned enough German at school to understand it
when spoken. But I do know the sound of it, and I
caught one or two words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Neill drew a long breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that U-boat isn’t lying on the bottom of the
inlet I’ll eat my hat!” he said. “Probably they
put up a collapsible boat last night and sent her round
to some other beach—they’ll take risks to get fresh
food. And to-night she’ll paddle back and get her
cargo of petrol, and the submarine will take her on
board and slide out to do a little more pirate-work.
But we may have a few remarks to make first. If I
only knew what Aylwin would want to do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat down, and put his face in his hands. Presently
he looked up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim—is there driftwood on the shore?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lots,” said Jim, briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right. Could we get some up on one of
the headlands?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—easily. We were bathing off the northern
point, and there’s quite an easy way up—it isn’t nearly
as high as the southern headland. Do you mean
enough for a fire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Mr. Linton, will you tell Captain Aylwin
that he need not come right in to shore. We will
build a signal-fire on the northern headland, and watch
the cave at low tide—that will be about two o’clock in
the morning. If the Germans come ashore, we’ll light
the fire—we can carry up a few bottles of petrol from
the motor supply to soak the drift-wood. Aylwin can
have a boat ready and come in if he sees the blaze;
unless he sees it he will know they won’t land for
another twenty-four hours, for they’ll never try it in
the daytime. Is that clear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite. I have only to describe the place to Captain
Aylwin, tell him about the signal-fire, and accompany
him if he needs me. Otherwise, I suppose I may
break the speed-limit in coming back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. There’s a wireless station up there—they’ll
get Aylwin for you. If he should be away
they will know where to send a message.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. And what will you three do?” David
Linton’s eyes lingered hungrily on his son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can only get the beacon ready, and then
watch. Two of us can hide near the cave, and the
third must be up on the point to light the fire if he
hears a shot. If they come—well, we must let them
land and get to the cave; and then we must try to
prevent their getting back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will be heavily outnumbered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—but the advantage of surprise will be on our
side, and we can take cover. I do not dare to get
help; it may not be safe to trust anyone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” David Lint on said, quietly. “Will
you order the motor, O’Neill? I can be off in three
minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook hands with the boys, wishing them luck
very gravely knowing that in all probability it was
the last time he should speak to them. Jim went
downstairs with him, without a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Con and the motor were at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be there by eight o’clock, with luck,”
O’Neill said. “Remember, you’re racing, Con. And——”
He dropped his voice. “I’ll keep him safe
for you if I can, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” said David Linton. He shook hands with
his boy again. The motor whirred off in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went up the staircase in silence, to where
Norah and Wally waited for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wally has told me all about it,” said Norah, pale,
but steady-eyed. “Oh, Sir John, I could help! Do
let me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can help by keeping out of harm’s way,” he
told her, gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you all fighting!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Norah, dear, we can’t have you in it,” O’Neill
said. “I know it’s hard: far harder than anything
we have to do. But you have too much sense not to
know that this isn’t woman’s work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah choked back a sob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you couldn’t have me where there’s shooting,”
she said. “But I can do something, if you’ll
let me: and in Australia women always did help men
when there was need, and they didn’t talk about things
being ‘women’s work.’ Women had to fight the
blacks, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Norah, we <span class='it'>can’t</span> let you fight,” Jim said. “Be
sensible, old kiddie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to fight,” said poor Norah. “At
least, I do, but I know that’s out of the question. But
why on earth shouldn’t I light the beacon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because there would be risk,” O’Neill said roughly.
“Norah, I hate hurting you. Don’t make it harder
for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to, indeed I don’t,” Norah faltered.
“But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” There was a lump in her throat, and
she turned away, fighting for her voice. Jim’s arm
round her shoulders steadied her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know you’ll be outnumbered,” she said.
“You can’t tell any of these people, and there are
only the three of you until daddy brings help. And
one of you is going to light the beacon! If you let
me do it, it leaves you all free to fight; and there’s no
risk to me. No one will be on the point. I’d only
have to light a match and get out of the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Wally, his young voice strained. “You
aren’t going to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know what it will be,” Norah said. “The one
of you who lights the beacon will come tearing down
the rocks to help the others, and the Germans will
just shoot him easily. I needn’t do that; I can hide
up on the point. There isn’t any risk—not a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Norah, Norah, I wish you’d gone to bed!”
uttered Jim. “Don’t you see we can’t let you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t,” said his sister. “You haven’t any
right to stop me. You know it will be only a chance
if you three can stop the submarine going out if help
doesn’t come in time. And if there are only two of
you, it’s so much less chance. Dad’s gone away
looking dreadful, only he wouldn’t say a word, because
he knows he hasn’t any right to hinder you.” Norah
was sobbing openly now. “And you have no right
to lose any chances. We can’t let that beastly thing
go out, to sink other ships full of women and kiddies
like the <span class='it'>Lusitania</span> babies. Goodness knows I’m f-fool
enough,” said poor Norah. “But at least I can put a
match to a fire!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s quite right,” Jim said, quietly. “All serene,
Nor. Buck up, old kiddie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim—you can’t——!” Wally burst out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t agree to it,” John O’Neill said, wretchedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s quite right,” Jim repeated. “The job is
bigger than we are. It’s only a question, as she says,
if all three of us can check those people at the cave:
and if we can get the beacon lit in any other way, we
simply have no right to reduce our number by one-third.
There really should be no danger: she has
only to put a match to it, and get away before the
firelight shows her up.” He spoke firmly, but his
young face was drawn and haggard. “I am quite
sure dad would say the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know he would,” Norah said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I thought this was rather a lark!” said
Wally, with a groan. He turned and walked to the
window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you are certain your father would be satisfied,
I have no more to say,” O’Neill said. “It certainly
makes an enormous difference: three can stop a rush
where two would be hopelessly outclassed. And the
man coming down from the headland wouldn’t have a
chance: the people on the submarine would get him
in a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember,” said Wally sharply, turning from the
window, “as soon as your match is lit, duck, and crawl
away. That old wood will flare wildly directly it’s
lit, if it’s soaked in petrol. Don’t wait a second.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t,” said Norah, and nodded at him cheerfully.
“Don’t worry; I’ll be all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right! I think it’s awful to let you do it!”
Wally uttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wally, I’ve <span class='it'>got</span> to. Don’t you see I have?”
Norah put her hand on his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose I do,” he said. “All our lives put
together don’t matter twopence if we can put an end
to even one submarine. I know we must let you.
But I wish to goodness we’d left you in Australia!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wally!” Norah flushed scarlet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I didn’t mean to be a beast,” the boy
said, contritely. “Only—I just can’t stand it!”
He went out, his swift strides echoing down the corridor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t mind him, little chap: he’s only worried
about you,” Jim said, gently. “He’ll be all right
when he comes back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At any rate, we mustn’t have you bothered,” Sir
John said, patting Norah’s shoulder. “You’ll need
to be quite calm and cool for your job, and for getting
away quietly after it. And I really don’t believe
you’ll be in any danger; the Germans can’t possibly
rake that point with gunfire from the submarine.
They might hit a standing figure, but not one lying
flat. And I hope the men on shore will be too busy
to take interest in beacons.” There was a grim note
in his voice, but his face was extraordinarily happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The more I think of it,” Jim said, “the more
likely it seems that we’re here just in time. You
see, they can’t get into the cave except at low tide;
and of course they want darkness. But there’s very
little darkness just now; it’s twilight until nearly
ten o’clock, and then dawn comes not long after three,
or even earlier. The tide is out just before dawn:
the very best time for them to work. In a few days
it would not suit them nearly so well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so,” O’Neill said. “Everything seems to
point to to-night or to-morrow. I would hope with
all my heart for to-night if I were sure of Aylwin getting
here in time; for every day means more risk of their
suspecting us, especially if they are in league with any
of the people on shore. The Irish peasants are very
quick to suspect a stranger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I hope it’s to-night!” Norah cried. “But,
Sir John, supposing we can—I mean, you and the
boys can——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit of it—it’s certainly ‘we,’ ” said O’Neill,
laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, supposing we can cut off the men who come
ashore. What will the submarine do? We can’t
touch her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s where Aylwin comes in, of course,” O’Neill
said. “If we can cut off the shore party and keep
them from rejoining the submarine, I don’t think she
can get away. She would not have much fuel, for
one thing; and for another, she does not carry enough
men to spare those we may have the luck to bag. She
would probably submerge; but she can’t remain
below more than twenty-four hours; and then the
destroyer would get her easily. Of course, there is a
lot of supposition about it all. I am calculating by
the little I know of submarines, but the Germans may
have a later and more powerful pattern that I don’t
understand, with a larger crew. We can only do our
best. It ought to be a good fight, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A knock came, and Jim opened the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The misthress is afther sending me up to say the
dinner’ll be spoilt on ye,” said a patient voice.
“Them little chickens do be boiled to rags; ’tis that
tender they are they’d fall asunder if you did but
prod them with your finger!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll hurry, Mary,” said Jim. “Come on, you
people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dinner!” said Norah. “Oh, I don’t believe I
could eat any.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you could,” said Wally, appearing suddenly.
“Little girls who won’t eat dinner can’t light bonfires!”
He tucked her hand into his arm and raced
her down the staircase. At the foot, he stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Norah, I’m sorry,” he said. “Is it all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it’s all right,” said Norah. “But you
were never cross with me before, in all your life, and
don’t you do it again!”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>D</span>INNER at the Carrignarone Hotel, where the
Australians and Sir John were the only guests,
was apt to be a lengthy and hilarious affair, with
everybody very hungry and very merry, and with
jokes flying, much to the disorganization of the waitress,
who was wont to spend much of her time in
clapping her hand over her mouth and rushing from
the room. When the necessities of the meal forbade
these hasty retreats, the waitress was apt to explode
in short, sharp gasps, greatly endangering whatever
dish she happened to be handing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This evening, however, the younger members of
the party were inclined to be unusually silent. Mr.
Linton’s vacant seat was in itself depressing; and
since it was impossible to talk of the subject seething
in their minds, conversation of any kind was not easy.
But John O’Neill was like a child; and before long
they all fell under the spell of his merriment. Never
had they seen him in such a happy mood. Every line
was smoothed from his worn face, and his eyes danced
with an eager joy that was almost uncanny. All his
being seemed transformed in the complete contentment
that had possession of him. Deliberately he set
himself to make the others laugh; and succeeded so
well that they astonished themselves by making an
extremely good dinner and feeling, at its conclusion,
considerably reinforced for the work that lay before
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Neill led the way out to the little landing-stage
near the inn, where the fishing-boats were anchored,
their brown nets drying on rough fences on the beach.
They sat down on some upturned fish-boxes, looking
westward across the water, where the sun was preparing
to set in a glory of golden cloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I’m going to be sensible,” Sir John said.
“I’ve been thinking out a plan of campaign, and I
want your views.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He brought out from his pocket a plan of the inlet,
drawn by Jim—a companion to the one Mr. Linton
had carried to Captain Aylwin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have ‘Flat Rock’ marked here over the cave,”
he said. “Is that the rock you were sitting on when
Wally dropped his knife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s the one,” Jim answered. “It has a
cleft in it through which the knife went down—just
wide enough to admit the knife. It’s really a kind of
lid over the rocks that form the first cave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you said there were loose boulders lying
on it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; big fragments of rock. I should think
that a big chunk of the cliff must have fallen on it
once, probably splitting it and making the crack, and
breaking itself as well. A lot of it went down: the
biggest piece buried itself partly in the sand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the boulder that almost hides the entrance,
then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim nodded assent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s about three feet from the entrance and a good
deal wider than it,” he said. “There are so many
similar rocks lying about that it would be quite easy
to miss the cave altogether.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I take it that the top of the flat rock is above
high-water mark?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” Jim answered. “High-water mark is
about a foot over the top of the entrance, and the rock
is quite four feet higher than that. Otherwise I don’t
fancy the waves would have left those big pieces of
loose rock lying on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I wanted to know. Now listen.
Suppose the Germans land, and most of them disappear
into the caves, to fish for petrol. What is to hinder
two active people, armed with levers, from sending
down from the top of the rock enough boulders to block
the entrance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim started, his pipe falling from his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By—Jove!” he uttered. “What a ripping
idea!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, we could do it as easily as possible,” Wally
said, excitedly. “The rocks are quite close to the
edge: one of them is so loose that we were rocking it
this afternoon. We’ve pretty hefty muscles—we
could send half a dozen over in no time with a couple
of iron bars. Glory, O’Neill, you <span class='it'>have</span> a head!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Jim, his eyes dancing—“and they
could hardly miss the entrance, because the big boulder
in front would prevent their rolling out too far. What
chumps we were, not to think of it, Wal!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’d have the Germans like rats in a trap—and
with no shooting at all!” Norah cried, delightedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something like that: with luck,” said O’Neill.
“Of course, they would have a guard posted outside,
and another at the boat. But the main crowd would
be inside, I should think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s really rather a staggering notion, it’s so
simple,” Jim said. “And I don’t see how it can go
wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It certainly simplifies our plan of action,” O’Neill
remarked. “And it doesn’t beat us, even if it fails;
you would have to jump down among the boulders,
in that case, and do the best you could with your
revolvers as the people inside came out—which they
would do in a hurry. My own little game must be the
boat and the guard at it. It’s rather important that
it should not be allowed to get back; a submarine
without a collapsible is rather like a horse with a lame
leg.” He turned his face towards the sunset, its
expression of child-like happiness stronger than ever.
“Wow! isn’t it going to be a jewel of a fight!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you the Berserk!” he said. “But I don’t
much like being separated. You’ll be careful, O’Neill,
won’t you, and keep well behind cover? There are
plenty of boulders near where they must land.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather!” Sir John answered. “For once in my
life I have a job that matters, and I’m certainly not
going to risk carrying it out by getting shot unnecessarily.
They won’t leave a strong guard at the boat:
a submarine crew is too limited to use many men, and
then, so far as we know, they feel perfectly safe, and
have no reason to take extra precautions. Speed will
be their main idea; they must make the most of the
short time between low-water and daylight.” He
swung round towards Norah, smiling at her. “How
are you feeling, mate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m feeling very cheerful,” said Norah, whose face
bore out her words. “There isn’t nearly so much
danger for the boys on top of the rock, is there, Sir
John?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not; if they can block the entrance from
above they may not even have to use their revolvers—which
will be a sad blow to them,” O’Neill answered.
“I’m always against promiscuous shooting, especially
when there are ladies present—even to satisfy fire-eaters
like Wally and Jim!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure you’ll be all right, Sir John?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be as right as possible,” he assured her, laughing
at her anxious face. “All I have to do is to sit comfortably
behind my little rock and pot at fat Germans;
and when you hear me potting, you can light the
beacon and crawl away with discreet haste. I hope
you realize that we couldn’t carry out this plan at all
if we hadn’t you as fire-lighter: we couldn’t do without
a fourth hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad,” Norah said, happily. “When do we
start, Sir John?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll slip out about half-past nine,” he answered.
“You and I will stroll along in one direction, and the
boys in another, and we can meet near the northern
headland where we must have the beacon. Each of
us must carry a bottle of petrol—I’ll see to getting
them ready; and as we go we can pick up stray bits
of wood. There is driftwood everywhere on the beach,
and we can collect plenty beyond the inlet: I don’t
want to go there, nor do I want to show up on the
north headland while there is much light. We don’t
know where the Germans you saw this evening may
be hiding—though I would think, judging from the
direction in which they were going, that their boat
must be hidden in a tiny bay that lies south of the
inlet. Still, it doesn’t do to risk things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose,” said Wally, “those fellows with the
boat will stay wherever they are hiding until nearly
low-water; then they’ll pull round to the inlet, and
the submarine will bob up, and they’ll take the other
men on board and go ashore after the petrol.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the most likely thing,” O’Neill said. “We
must be in position long before that. A good thing
it’s a warm night: still, we shall have to lie still for a
good while, and you’d better dress warmly, all of
you.” He looked at his watch. “Nine o’clock, and
time we began to get ready. There are crowbars in
the old shed Con used as a garage, boys; I noticed them
this morning. I’m going after bottles for the petrol.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood up, looking at the three young faces.
They were all eager; but it was as though a living
light glowed in his own dark eyes. He held his gallant
head high, the twisted body forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to say ‘Thank you,’ only I don’t know
how,” he said. “If you hadn’t come, this wouldn’t
have happened; and now, whatever comes, I’ll always
have it to remember that just once in my life I had a
chance of a man’s job.” His light stride carried him
quickly across the beach.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>N the little inlet, shadowed by the high rocks,
everything was very quiet. The tide was running
out rapidly: foot by foot the smooth boulders came
out of the sea, to stand like sentinels until once more
the heaving green water should swing back and climb
gently until it rippled over their heads. Inch by
inch the opening grew, forming the entrance to the
cave under the rocks, and the water slid out as though
rejoicing to escape from its dark prison within and to
seek the laughing freedom of the sea that tumbled
beyond the headlands. Overhead a half-moon sailed,
now and then blotted out by drifting clouds; and in
the East was the faintest glimmer of the coming dawn.
But the water of the little bay lay black and formless,
and though the sands showed, visible and pale, the
shadows that lay about the great boulders were like
pools of ink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the flat rock over the cave Jim and Wally
crouched, now and then moving cautiously to keep
their tired limbs from stiffening. It was very cold,
in the silent hour before dawn. Two hours earlier
they had climbed down from above, making use of
the scant moonlight or clinging like limpets to the cliff
when the clouds blotted out the moon’s faint radiance:
glad to arrive at their destination with nothing worse
than bruises and torn clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once on the rock, they had set about their preparations:
crawling all over it, making sure of knowing
every inch in the dark, and becoming acquainted
with each boulder that lay upon its surface. They
tested them with their crowbars in the darkness, and
found it possible to move all but two or three. The
great fragment that balanced near the edge they
levered nearer still, so that only a little effort would
be needed to send it crashing down; and then they
moved others near it, working with caution that was
almost painful, lest even a scratch of rock on rock
should carry a warning across the dark water. Below
them, the waves had at first rippled and splashed
against the crags; but gradually they receded, and
leaning over, lying flat on the stone, they could make
out the position of the great boulder that marked the
entrance to the cave, and so make sure that their
balanced rock was in the right place. Then there was
nothing to do but wait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How the minutes dragged! Far up on the northern
headland, Norah crouched among sparse furze and
heather, unheeding the prickly branches that forbade
comfort. The edge of the low cliff prevented her
seeing the inlet; she could only watch the dim outline
of the coast, stretching northward, and the stormy sky
with its hurrying clouds. Before her loomed dimly
the heap of petrol-soaked wood and furze which they
had roughly piled in the darkness behind a boulder
that hid it from watching eyes, should any be on the
alert. She had expected to be afraid when at last
they had all shaken hands with her and wished her luck
before creeping away to their posts; but now she
found that she had no sense of fear. Jim had stayed
behind for a moment and kissed her, calling her “old
kiddie” in the way she loved. In the agony of wondering
if she would ever hear his voice again there was
no room for fear for herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John O’Neill had had longer to wait before climbing
down to the beach. He had lain on the edge of the
high ground, motionless, taking advantage of every
moonlit moment to learn by heart the scene below as
the tide crawled backward. Jim’s plan was fresh in
his memory: now he stared at each boulder, studying
opportunities for cover and making out the path that
the Germans must take to the cave. He knew where
it was, though he could not see it: it relieved him, too,
that he was unable to discern Jim and Wally, or to
hear the faintest sound of their presence, although he
knew they must be on the rock. Finally, he made his
cautious way to the beach, and followed the tide out
yard by yard, creeping from one shadow to another:
a shadow himself, white-faced and frail, among the
rugged boulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was very cold, on the wet sand; he shivered, and
his teeth chattered. He fell to rubbing himself
steadily, chafing his wrists and ankles; but it seemed
as though the long watch would never end. Once,
when the clouds suddenly blew apart and the moon
shone more brightly, he fancied he saw a dim shape
outside the headlands: a shape that might have been
a ship. But before he had time to be certain the dark
masses overhead drifted together once more, leaving
him in doubt as to whether it had not been his imagination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shadow of dawn came in the east, and O’Neill
felt his heart sink. They were not coming, after all:
soon it would be daylight and the tide would turn and
come creeping back to hide the cave for another twelve
hours. For a moment the keenness of disappointment
made him shiver, suddenly colder than he had ever
been; and then his heart thumped and the blood seemed
to rush through his veins. Something, long, and
grey, and very faint was showing on the water. It
was not a dream: he heard a faint plash that he knew
was an oar, muffled yet distinct in the deep stillness:
and then a low mutter of a voice, coming across the
sea to him. He drew a long, satisfied breath, and
felt a hatchet that hung at his belt, as he had felt it a
hundred times, to make sure that it hung where he
could draw it easily. Then his hand closed on the
revolver in his coat-pocket and clung to it almost
lovingly. For the first time in his life it did not matter
in the least that he was a hunchback.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The low sound of oars came nearer, and gradually,
out of the darkness, a boat loomed upon the water and
grounded softly on the strand. They were not half a
dozen yards from where O’Neill crouched in a patch
of black shadow, watching between two rocks. The
men in her stepped out, quietly, but showing no sense
of danger. They were more in number than he had
expected; there would be a stiff fight if Jim and
Wally failed to trap them. He crouched lower, scarcely
daring to breathe. Then one who was evidently in
command gave a low curt order and they filed off along
the winding path between the strewn boulders, leaving
two of their number in the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rocks hid the main body for a moment. The
guards worked the boat round until her bow pointed
outwards in readiness for the run back to the submarine;
then they came out, stamping on the sand
to keep warm. One of them, a thick-set fellow in
oilskins, strode inland a few yards, pausing so close
to O’Neill that the Irishman could have touched him,
and for a sick instant he thought he was discovered;
but the sailor strolled back to his companion with a
muttered curse at the cold, and they stood by the
boat, talking in low tones. O’Neill searched the rocks
with his eyes, straining to see the entrance to the cave.
Surely it was time for them to have reached it. Would
the sound he longed for never come?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came a long reverberating crash, and another,
and yet another and a long, terrible cry, and above it a
shrill whistle. The men on the beach swung round,
breaking into a torrent of bewildered furious speech.
On the northern headland came a flicker of light that
spread upwards and soared in a sheet of flame; and
simultaneously Sir John fired at the man nearest him
and saw him pitch into the water on his face. The
second man rushed at him as he rose from behind the
rock, and he fired again, and missed; and the German
Was upon him, towering over the slight, misshapen
form, and firing as he came. O’Neill felt a sharp agony
in his side. The two revolvers rang out together, and
the German staggered and fell bodily upon him, crushing
him to the sand, while his revolver flew from his
hand, splashing into a pool in a rock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Irishman twisted himself from under the inert
weight, and struggled to his feet. A German was
rushing towards the boat, threading his way among
the rocks, his face desperate in its bewilderment and
rage. The sight gave strength to John O’Neill anew;
he ran to the boat, staggering as he ran, and pulling
at his hatchet. There were dark stains on it as he
grasped it. The German saw his intention and
shouted furiously, and shots began to whistle past
O’Neill. There was no time to look: he flung himself
into the boat, hacking wildly at the bottom, smiling
as it split under his blows and he felt the cold inrush
of the water round his feet. The German was upon
him: just once he glanced aside from his work and
saw the cruel face and the levelled revolver very close,
somewhere it seemed that Jim and Wally were shouting.
He smiled again, turning for a final blow at the boat.
Then sea and rock and sky seemed to burst round
him, with a deafening roar, in a blaze of white light
that turned the grey dawn into a path of glory.</p>

<hr class='tbk101'/>

<p class='pindent'>He woke from a dreamless sleep. They were all
about him: kind faces that loved him, that bent over
him speaking gently. Some one had propped his
head, and had spread coats over him: he was glad of
it, for he was very cold. The wavering faces steadied
as his vision grew clearer, and he saw them all: David
Linton and the boys, and Norah kneeling by him, her
eyes full of tears. That troubled him, and he groped
for her hand, and held it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t cry,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some one raised his head a little, putting a flask to
his lips. He drank eagerly. Then he saw another face
he knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, Aylwin!” he said. “Did you get her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sailor nodded. “Don’t talk, old man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Neill laughed outright. The brandy had brought
life back to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m perfectly well,” he said. “Tell me, Jim—quick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We got them quite easily,” Jim said, his voice
shaking. “The first rock blocked the entrance, and
they’re there yet. We sent down all the rocks, and
one fell on one of the two guards they left; the other
managed to wing Wally before he ran.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Neill started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he hurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only my arm,” said Wally. “It’s quite all right—don’t
you worry. It wasn’t much to pay for the haul
we got—thanks to you.” The boyish face twitched,
and he put out his hand and took O’Neill’s in its
grip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on, please,” Sir John begged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The other chap ran,” Jim said: “of course his
idea was to get the boat back to the submarine. The
brute got a start of us while we were making sure the
others were blocked in securely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you put a guard there?” O’Neill interrupted,
anxiously. “They might break out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half a dozen of my men,” Aylwin said, quickly.
“It’s all right, old chap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We saw him begin to fire at you, and we did our
best,” said Jim, with a groan. “We didn’t dare fire,
for fear of hitting you, until we were close. Then we
got him—but——” His strained voice ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t worry—his mate had fixed me first,”
said O’Neill, serenely. “It was great luck I had, to be
able to get to the boat at all: your man didn’t matter.”
He laughed happily. “This makes up for having lived.
Tell me your part of it, Bob.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We got down in very good time,” Aylwin said.
“The ship couldn’t come in, of course; but I’ve a
handy motor-boat with a gun rigged in her, and we
sneaked in and lay just under the south headland. It
was quite simple; we were into the inlet before the
first flare died down, and there was the submarine, with
nothing doing. It was as easy as shelling peas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it was your gun .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?” O’Neill said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. We’re on guard, of course; but she won’t
come up again. When it’s light we’ll deal with the
gentlemen in the cave.” The sailor’s curt voice became
even more abrupt. “Never saw a show better
planned—the whole thing went like clockwork. I
always knew you had the makings of a general in you,
Jack!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Neill gave a quick, happy sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boys and Norah did it all,” he said. “But
it was splendid fun, to be able to take a hand. I said
it would be a jewel of a fight!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A slow wave of weakness stole over him, and he
closed his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the tide coming in?” he said, presently. “I
thought I felt it—creeping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim took off his coat and put it on his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll get you up to the motor presently,” he said,
his young voice unsteady. O’Neill laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not before the finish,” he said. “It won’t be
long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah’s head went down suddenly on his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t die!” she said,—“we can’t spare you,
dear Sir John. We’re going to make you better!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dying is only a very little matter, dear little
mate,” O’Neill said. “It’s living that hurts. And
just think of what I have—a man’s finish! That is a
great thing, when one has lived a hunchback.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not speak for a long time, lying with closed
eyes. The dawn was breaking: light grew on the
surface of the inlet, where long streaks of oil floated
on the ripples. They watched the quiet figure. Under
the coats that covered him, all traces of deformity were
lost. Something of new beauty had crept into the
high-bred features; and when he opened his eyes again
they were like the smiling eyes of a child. They met
Jim’s, and the lips smiled too, while his weak hand
rested on Norah’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I worrying,” he said, “because I was out of
the war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had your own job,” said Aylwin. “And you
pulled it off, old man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was great luck,” O’Neill said. “God had pity.
Enormous luck .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to finish at a man’s job.” He
did not speak again. The sun, climbing upwards, shone
tenderly upon the happy face.</p>
